I’m currently planning the reception and I have already secured a venue. I was having a discussion with my fiancé (27F) about possible food options (catering or cooking, what types of food, buffet style or served, etc.) and my mother (60F) and one of my aunts (56F) were visiting. They threw in some thoughts and advice, as they’ve had weddings, which I really appreciate. The topic of drinking came up, and my aunt asked what kind of cocktails we’d be serving. I told her we wouldn’t be serving alcohol at the wedding. She was shocked and asked what everyone was going to drink. I told her there would be water, sweet tea, lemonade, fruit-punch, and soda available.\n\nMy aunt said that having soda was a bad idea because it’s so unhealthy, and so is sweet tea and overly sugary lemonade and fruit-punch. I told her if was so concerned about sugar content she could stick with water, and we’re planning on having plenty of fresh fruit she could add to it. We’d also have unsweet tea for my diabetic family members, or they’re welcome to request or bring a desirable alternative. She asked why alcohol couldn’t be a request. I told her I simply didn’t want to serve any at my wedding. My fiancé and I would be financially responsible for the purchase (and alcohol would frankly be out of our budget) and we would feel responsible for their actions. She asked if she and the other drinkers of the family could bring their own beer and said it really wouldn’t be a party without one. I said no, again, because it’s my wedding and fiancé and I would feel responsible for drunk guests. We also want to have a wedding that’s fun and happy because everyone there loves each other and is happy to celebrate their family/our union.\n\nShe said it was already a shame I wasn’t getting married in a church and the least I could do was make up for it with a good reception. I told her if she can’t go one evening without drinking then maybe she’s the one with a problem. At this point my mom jumped in and told me I need to apologize, I said no, I don’t appreciate how my aunt has spoken to me and she needs to leave. They ended up going, but then my aunt complained the next day on Facebook about my “dry wedding” and said she wasn’t going to torture herself driving an hour and a half to my venue just to have a bad time. She also explained how the conversation went the day before and said I called her a drunk for being healthy. I’ve been getting a lot of messages, some supportive, some on the fence, and some very angry that I want to “ruin a good reception by acting like it’s the prohibition era”. I’m honestly confused here, am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: my aunt’s health comment wasn’t about beer, it was about wine. She believes a glass a day is important for maintaining health and she drinks at least one glass every single day. She’s also hopped on the intermittent fasting trend, so I take her “health advice” with a grain of salt. Especially since she probably meets the medical threshold for alcoholism. \n\nAlso, another reason I don’t want alcohol is because this is a specifically kid friendly event. I want my little cousins and nieces/nephews and my fiancé’s younger family members to be able to attend. I don’t feel comfortable hosting an all-ages event with lots of alcohol and drunk adults present. A lot of my family members do not behave when they’re drunk.\n\nEDIT 2: For those saying I should make the “dry” part clear in advance, I planned on having the entire food and drink situation for the wedding figured out and announced six months before the date. I wasn’t going to spring it on people last minute. Everyone was going to be informed and then further reminded on the Save-The-Date’s and the invites! I’m also not anti-alcohol or something. I like drinking, there are just too many concerning factors and liabilities with allowing it at my wedding, including the incredibly expensive cost of providing the alcohol.\n\nEdit 3: To everyone suggesting a cash bar, that would invariably make this situation worse. My relatives expect me to provide alcohol for free. If I tell them they have to pay they will complain more. One of my uncles was arrested last year because the price of his favorite brand of beer went up and he stole his next 12-pack because “he deserved it after how much money he gave to that company”. He still thinks the cops and the store were in the wrong.\n\nEdit 4: Very tired of people not reading or simply ignoring what I’ve already made clear and twisting my words. I’ve explained my case.

We went with my dad and his fiancé (one of my sisters being her daughter). A few months prior to this, my uncle asked me to be the photographer at his wedding as i had done it as a qualification. (me being the photographer is kind of relevant). \n\nDuring the wedding i made sure to only consume a little alcohol. not even enough for a buzz. so during the dinner i was completely sober. my dad and his fiancé however, we’re completely wasted. realistically speaking, i was the only sober person there (legal age to drink in the UK is 18). \n\nMy dads fiancé kept allowing my 14 year old sister to drink. At one point me and my little sister (17) told her to stop drinking because she kept staggering by the pool and we didn’t want her to hurt herself. however my dads very drunk fiancé kept insisting that she was fine and she could have more. \n\nNow in the last year, i’ve personally had really bad experiences whilst drinking, i wont bore you with the details but both included very drunk men and one even included the police. I’m very cautious of my little sisters safety due to this as even though they have people around them to protect them (as did i at the time) something may still happen. \n\nTowards the end of the night my dads fiancé told my little sister she could get another drink and i exploded a little. saying things like “that’s your last one” and “we aren’t responsible for what happens to you if you carry on”. My dads fiancé turned around and basically said i wasn’t her mother. I’m fully aware of this fact. however being the only sober adult at the table, i was trying to make sure everyone was safe and my 14 year old sister was at a point where if she walked off alone she wouldn’t be. \n\nI then turned around to my dads fiancé and said “respectfully i love you and i appreciate everything you’ve done for me, my sisters and my dad but neither are you”. \n\nHer parents pulled me aside after this and told me that they agreed and i later found out from my uncle (the groom) that he agreed and he felt that my dad and his fiancé were forgetting how old my sister is. \n\nMy dad, 17 year old sister and step mum all expected me to give an apology, however everyone else who attended the wedding agreed with what i had said. \n\nSo AITA for telling my dads fiancé the truth even though it probably hurt her?\n\nquick edit: me and my dad are now on speaking terms as father’s day just passed and i was the only one of his kids who got him something. i still haven’t spoken to my dads fiancé and actually just missed my dads weekend to have us because i covered someone’s shift at work. i’ve also spoken to my sister (17) and she understands why i did what i did.\n\nanother edit: i’m reading all the comments, first of all thank you everyone who has left one. i’m so happy even some of you are sharing your own stories. second, to the few people who have said that i’m a good older sister, it’s really warming my heart. thank you so much.\n\nok final update: me and my sisters (17 &amp; 14) are from my mum and dad. my dads fiancé is our step mum. my 15 year old sister is my step mums daughter from her previous marriage. i hope that clears some thing up', 't2_p37fci83', 'AITA for telling my dads fiancé that she isn’t our parent?

Why has America been at war for over 90% of its existence? How come we have never had a leader who stopped the wars?

I love her to death, but her addiction was making things in both of our lives very hard, so I’m very proud of her for finally working up the resolve to get our lives back. Since then, we have both avoided alcohol like it’s cyanide. \n\nOn to the issue: \n\nEvery year, my parents throw a blowout anniversary party. They have more money than they know what to do with, and hospitality is both of their passions, so needless to say it’s a huge deal in my family. Unfortunately, my family are a bunch of rowdy drunks and there is enough alcohol at those parties to drown a small city.\n\nLast year, my girlfriend got way too drunk and got in a screaming match with my cousin and has since been pretty alienated from my family. She’s confessed to me that that incident was one of the reasons she decided to quit, but that it took time to work up the willpower to actually go through with it.\n\nAbout two weeks before the party, I contacted my parents to let them know that my girlfriend and I would not be attending because of my girlfriend’s recovery. They told me that they were sad about my girlfriend’s absence but that they understood, but expressed confusion as to why I couldn’t come. I explained that I wanted to stay home and support her. My parents sounded annoyed but accepted my decision. \n\nA couple days later, my sister texted me and accused me of choosing my girlfriend over my family. She said that my dad probably doesn’t have long to live (he has diabetes, heart issues, and autoimmune disease, but he’s not on his death bed by any means) and that I’m being selfish because I’m helping my girlfriend “wallow in self pity instead of  helping her face her mistakes and own up to our family”. Various other family members have reached out and expressed similar sentiments, and my girlfriend has even said that she’d be fine with me going. \n\nI feel like I’m the only one holding out on this, and I’m worried that I’m being overly stubborn.

I al\n\nDrugs - addiction, illegal, tolerance gained over time. In my country weed is not legal\n\nSmoking - lungs, looked down on and banned in a lot of public spaces, smell gets into furniture\n\nGaming - carpal tunnel, dry eye syndrome, bad posture.\n\nI think gaming overall is the least worrisome form of escapism. And I won't be an edgy gamer or a troll and stuff like that, no harassing people online.\n\nIf anyone knows any other vice that is pretty safe and does not hurt you long term please recommend it and I will give you a delta, but it must be better or very close to the gaming vice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", 't2_o9r14c8m', 'CMV: Gaming is the least worst "vice" for escapism compared to drugs, alcohol, smoking, etc', 't3_14ldlnx', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14ldlnx/cmv_gaming_is_the_least_worst_vice_for_escapism/')

There is a (now de-bunked) saying that it takes 21 days to make a habit. The research says it takes about 66 days to make something a habit, and 254 days to make a full lifestyle change. However, I decided to challenge myself and tack on a new challenge every 21 days. It is a good point of self-reflection for me to see if I have any vices that are ingrained as habits in my life.\n\n**ALCOHOL - Day 39:** I do not mind being without alcohol. I only miss it when I think about going out and enjoying a cocktail. However, not buying wine from the grocery store and removing my habit of having wine 2-4 times a week after work is not bad, and I appreciate the change. I have gone out a few times (see below), and seeing bar-tenders get creative with virgin drinks has been fun.\n\n**CANNABIS -Day 21:** I decided to make cannabis my next challenge, because I noticed my cannabis consumption increased when I first went without alcohol. This one has been a harder thing to shake. I am realizing I have a lot more time on my hands, now that I\'m not couch locked. Then, I feel guilty for not being more productive. My motivation to do my work has been low and I have been justifying it by saying *"well, normally I would be high watching a cartoon at this time, so I have the ability to get it together with the time I do have."* It is not the mind-frame I want to have, so I have to work on it. I\'m still working on it. Being without cannabis is hard, but I\'m realizing more and more this is a self-discipline I should work on and I know future me will appreciate that I cut back on my cannabis use, if only for the financial savings. This is going to be hardest thing to make a habit.\n\n**GOING OUT TO EAT -Day 3:** Similar to when I noticed my going without alcohol increased my cannabis consumption, I noticed I grabbed more take-out and went out to eat more once I stopped taking cannabis. I did not realize how much I order Uber Eats, or spend time at a restaurant simply because I am looking for a comfort food, or even company from a bar-tender because I live alone. So, my next 21 day challenge is to not eat out and make all my food at home. I\'m currently on day 3. I\'m noticing I tend to buy produce that goes bad because I don\'t eat it. Learning to have a better relationship with knowing what\'s in my fridge and using it in a reasonable time period is going to be a nice look at myself.\n\n**Motivation:** I keep "countdown" widgets on my phone that show the days of sobriety. Seeing the days tick up is motivating to keep going. Also, knowing I am going to write you all after the 21 day period has been also a motivator. I don\'t know if anyone cares, but maybe it will help someone out there. At the end of the day, it\'s helpful for me to believe updates are helpful to someone out there. We are all on this journey of life trying to be functioning adults.

My mom found out how much I was drinking (hint: a lot) and she stopped me. People told me to replace it with weed. I thought why not try it. I can say it was a good choice though I\'ll need to do some shopping for the right products.\n\nFirst time- 3mg of an eddy. Sat there for three hours waiting for this thing to kick in before I said "yeah I\'m not getting high tonight". FaceTime my friend who\'s a stoner and he had to leave an hour in and he didn\'t sound too confident it\'d work 😅.\n\nSecond time- 7mg. Felt like I was floating on a frickin cloud. All my stress and worries were completely gone. I ran my hands across my skin on my arms, legs, and my skin felt like straight-up air or clouds. I had a small feeling of a lump in my throat which was uncomfortable, but passed quickly. Then, my muscle tension all over disappeared and my body felt light as a feather. I got full-body tingles for a bit which was real fun. Got the best sleep of my life after.\n\n3rd time- 5mg. Got the same lump in my throat, panicked that I was gonna die from an allergic reaction, FaceTimed my friend for 45 min who luckily calmed me down a bit and i put on a funny movie to feel better. Still felt anxious for two days after.\n\n4th time- 10mg. Got a new edible. The previous one was gummies, this new one was a cookie. Testing to see if I was allergic to the gummy. I was. No lump in throat. This one was infused with Blue Dream. Felt blissful and content all day. It was supposed to have an energizing effect, but it actually put me to sleep. Which I needed anyway as I was tired asf from finals week. Still felt good in the evening, re-watched the first few episodes of stranger things and all felt right in the world.\n\nThe good highs left me feeling blissful and content with life. They didn\'t make me sad like being drunk sometimes did.

This is weird to me as I know they both work on the gaba A receptor, not in the exact same way and definitely a distinctly different high as I hate alcohol. I\'ve heard this same thing about opiate users. They abuse them so much that they don\'t get high, just maintain and the drugs have lost their euphoria.\n\n  This same exact thing has happened to me with lyrica/gabapentin/phenibut. I have to space out the doses so much as I won\'t feel anything at all if I take them daily. I\'m sure lots of psychedelic users would like to trip daily but you simply can\'t take mushrooms every day as you eventually won\'t feel anything at all, and that would be very bad for your seratonin, as far as I\'m aware. Stimulants seem to at least still work, but they lose their euphoria quickly. When I abused weed after a while it didn\'t get me high, I was just smoking due to the mental addiction I had to it.

I am not good at introducing myself to people in a way that is genuine so I\'m just going to lay it all out there.  I\'d have trouble making a TL;DR, so no hard feelings if you don\'t read all this.\n\nI (40m) have to post this to hold myself accountable.  The closest rock bottom I can see for myself is either serious illness or death.  While I had my fair share of incidences involving alcohol in my twenties, I haven\'t really had any catastrophes w/ it in a very long time, and I don\'t foresee any on the horizon other than the two I just mentioned.\n\nThat\'s the problem with my drinking.  It\'s rarely problematic for anyone around me, and rarely even (immediately) to myself.  Because of this, I\'ve talked myself out of any real change for a very, very long time.  I\'ve drank most nights in the last 10 years.  When I say most, I mean it\'s a rare day out of the month that I don\'t drink.  It\'s mostly high gravity beer and vodka.  To quantify, it\'s usually 2-3 pints of 8%ish beer then 3 or 4 shots of vodka mixed into whatever drinks I have in the fridge as the night goes on.  (Typing that last sentence out was really embarrassing and makes me feel a lot of shame.)  I rarely get black out.  I typically just drink till I get tired, and I go to bed.  When I wake up I rarely feel hungover unless I really overdid it.  \n\nThat\'s another problem.  My tolerance is insane.  It always has been.  People have remarked my whole life about how I\'m "not a real human" or how I can drink anyone under the table - especially in my twenties.  Now that I\'m 40, my interest in partying or going to bars is long gone, but that tolerance paired with my magnetism to the substance has remained.  It has basically turned into me just being a really boring guy from 6p till the time I go to bed each night.  I wake up every day and go to work.  I manage a team.  I talk about my drinking here and there as if it is possibly problematic, but it\'s always in jest.  My coworkers do the same.  I even go out for drinks when we have a work function, and I\'m fine having a beer or two then just going home.  I\'m on a team of a few high-functioning alcoholics as well, and I get the sense that they like my current lifestyle (as much as they are able to perceive it) in as much as it validates their own choices.\n\nThis year I went 20 days without drinking in January.  It was the longest I\'ve gone in probably 15 years.  I had zero physical issues.  No DTs.  No sweats.  No change in appetite.  No extra energy.  Just same.  I eat mostly clean, and I exercise pretty regularly.  I hit my PR for my longest day hike ever this year (23 miles - 49k steps), and I\'m planning on running another 5k before the year is over.  Am I the picture of health minus alcohol?  Absolutely not, but I\'m doing pretty well for my age - which has actually done more harm in my decision making than good for the topic at hand.  Just another excuse for why I can always just stop drinking later.  Right?\n\nI\'m not even sure why I drink anymore.  I used to know.  It has surely been for different reasons over the years.  There was a point in time when I was using it to mask trauma, but I\'m not sure if that is the case anymore.  It definitely helps me turn down the volume of life around me.  I\'ve been told my whole life that I probably have some form of OCD.  I hyper fixate.  It\'s the reason this damn post is so long already and is only about to get longer.  Maybe I\'m self-medicating that?  I dunno.\n\nI swore I wouldn\'t touch any substance growing up as a kid because of my parents.  I\'m the son of two addicts.  They were teenagers when I was born.  When I was old enough to form thoughts about the world, I was told that I had a serious heart condition when I was about a year old and that my parents (as teenagers) were unable to get the treatment I needed so I was adopted by my grandparents (who had great insurance) with the promise I\'d go back to my parents once they got on their feet.\n\nAt least that\'s what I was told.  Ya see, my family does a LOT of lying.  I\'ve been on the inside of family secrets my whole life that I shouldn\'t have been as a child - which means there are plenty of which I was not on the inside.  When I was close to adulthood, I found out that my grandfather was sexually abusive to his kids.  I\'m also told that he was sexually abusive to me, but I have no memory of it.  I have fuzzy memories that don\'t make a lot of sense - but nothing I can point to as evidence that I was molested, and, at this point, I\'m not sure I\'ll ever know the truth (or if it even matters).  Ignorant to all of this, I idolized my grandfather.  He was a super wise man.  He worked for NASA and retired to a small rural piece of land about an hour outside of where he grew up (there were no street names or anything).  He built a farm there, and I came to live with him and my grandmother there shortly after.  They were very religious.  We were very active in church.  We went to tent revivals, watched people get slain in the spirit, and I even saw a few snake-handlings.  Ya know... the crazy religious kind of people.\n\nMy grandfather died when I was 14 leaving my grandmother, his three kids (my dad, uncle, and aunt), and myself - but not before he would write me into their will to receive 1/4 of the estate once my grandmother passed.  She chose to honor that wish and did so right up until she died in 2015 despite me telling her not to.  My aunt and her family still hate me for this and for other reasons I\'ll probably never understand.  My uncle is dead.  Alcohol wasn\'t the main reason I was given for his death, but I know it certainly played a part.  He called me out of the blue a few times in the last year of his life - always drunk and crying.  He never did that when I was younger, and he rarely reached out in my adulthood.  I found out way too late in life that he was possibly my father due to my mother\'s infidelity while they were all in high school.  That also makes a lot more sense about me getting adopted than the heart story, because I can\'t find records anywhere of me being hospitalized for heart trouble.  The truth of the matter w/ all of that likely died with him though so ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)\\_/¯\n\nMy grandmother went pretty crazy after my grandad died.  She left my hometown w/out inviting me (16 years old at the time) so I started crashing on one of my friend\'s couches.  I taught guitar lessons and worked at a furniture store to pay bills.  The parents of the friend who was letting me crash stole my car one morning which caused me to have a panic attack during a lesson later that day.  The parents of the kid I was teaching saw what happened, came to ask if I was okay, and ultimately let me stay with them till I graduated high school.  They saved my life.\n\nYou might have already gathered, but my parents never got on their feet.  My dad (alleged, I guess) ended up going to prison for most of my life (mostly related to forging prescriptions for drugs, drug-related burglary, etc.).  My mom ended up raising my half sister in what was well-known as a drug house in my hometown.  People would go there to shoot up and pass out.  I found out later in life that my sister was sexually abused a lot growing up.  I had no idea what to do with that information other than to feel guilty for not being there to protect her.\n\n  \nMy parents would blow in and out of my life in sections until I finally cut communication with both of them about 5 years ago.  I tried to keep a relationship with my father, but it\'s just not possible.  He\'s been trying to get clean his whole life, and I\'ve been as supportive as I can.  I probably "guest-attended" 200 NA/AA meetings in my early 20s with him.  He\'s bipolar, manic, manipulative, kind, smart, funny, and abusive.  The second hardest part of having him in my life was the whiplash from following him from persona to persona.  The hardest part was him trying to sabotage himself and everyone close to him over and over again with wild and blatant disregard leaving a huge wake of destruction of which my half-brothers (who don\'t talk to anyone on my dad\'s side of the family anymore) caught the worst parts.  My mother has had a few OD scares over the years, and that\'s about the only time I hear from her or her side of the family.\n\n(If you\'re still reading, thanks).  Anyway, I moved off to college after that and started dating a girl.  She got diagnosed pretty early into our relationship with terminal brain cancer.  I dropped out of college and started sleeping in hospital rooms with her almost every night.  We ended up getting engaged due to an intense amount of pressure from her family, and she cheated on me with her ex-bf before she died.  I was an emotional/mental wreck at that point.  I left town, and started completely over by myself in the city I\'m in now.  I played music for a living (I fronted a band) which gave me all the opportunity in the world to drink as much as I wanted as often as I wanted for fucking free.  (I was poor as hell.)  I was out every night, and I was drinking every night.  I found that I could make a ton of "friends" while I was drinking, and I started to experience community for the first time in my adult life.  I was told a lot that I was charismatic and fun to be around.  I got very good at reading crowds from fronting a band.  I also got very good at being fake.\n\nOne night, in my late 20\'s, I got the news that my grandmother was dying of cancer.  I took that news particularly rough that day, called a few friends, and went out to a bar.  I got smashed with a capital Z that night and got a DUI for sleeping in a church parking lot in my car with the keys in the ignition.  I went to jail for the first time.  It broke me.  Not because of the going to jail part, but because it proved to me that I was continuing the cycle that I had blamed for my own unhappiness for so long.\n\nThat next morning, something inside me snapped.  I knew that I had to make a change so I found a new job, saved up, and paid back all my dues from the DUI.  It felt like it took forever.  I had that embarrassing thing on my car that wouldn\'t let me drive if I couldn\'t blow sober.  I can\'t tell you how many mornings I woke up, and it wouldn\'t start because of my drinking the previous night.  I found an apartment that would let me move in with my shitty credit at the time.  I slowly started trying to build a life for myself.  \n\nOver the next ten years, I worked my way up in the company, made some new excellent friends, married an amazing woman, bought a house, and was actually able to build a really good life... except...\n\nI still drink.  I haven\'t been able to stop.  It makes no sense, because I love my life now for the first time in my existence.  I actually cherish the time I have on this earth, but I have not been able to stop poisoning myself out of it.  I\'m such a fucking hypocrite.  Everything in life is going fine.  What am I escaping FFS?!?\n\nA few weeks ago, a coworker died.  He was a guy that was pretty well known for hanging out around town in bars and drinking.  He and I had beers together several times at work functions and other social settings.  He seemed completely normal.  Just a fun, life-of-the-party kinda guy.  He showed up to work everyday and was a badass at his job.  Everyone loved him.  He started having stomach pain out of the blue one day.  They took him to the emergency room to discover his liver was just gone.  They sent him home with hospice care, and he died a few days later.  He was 46.  I can\'t know for certain, but I doubt his habit was as bad as mine.  \n\nEver since I heard this news a few weeks ago, I cut back a lot on drinking (more than half), but I haven\'t fully stopped.  I\'ve had some mild intestinal pain over the last few days (rare for me), and I can\'t stop thinking about what happened to my work buddy so recently.  I\'m not sure if I\'ve done permanent damage to myself or not at this point in life, but I really hope I haven\'t.  I\'m scared that the only other rock bottom in front of me is the big one, but that it will just sneak up on me by attrition due to the "high-functioning" systems I\'ve put in place for myself.  This has to stop.  I cannot continue to live this way, and therefore I will not continue to live this way.  I really appreciate anyone who took the time to read this heap of words I cobbled together.  I hope I can look at this in the future to remind myself why I stopped today and can never start again.  \n\nIWNDWYT', 't2_791lm6ywe', 'Day 1 - High Functioning Alcoholism is a Slippery Slope', 't3_14i64ms', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/14i64ms/day_1_high_functioning_alcoholism_is_a_slippery/')

I was devastated, and he said he regrets it, and would not drink again for the foreseeable future. Prior to that, every time we would drink, we would get in really intense arguments and he had really been mean to me at one point. Never physically abusive, but he would just say things that he knew would hurt me. Out of support, and also for my own well being, I quit drinking as well. A month later, he proposed to me, and we began planning our wedding to be September 16th of this year. \n\nA little more background on my fiancé’s relationship with alcohol: he got a DUI in 2019 before we were together and completed a year and a half of sobriety at that time. This charge has prevented him from a lot of good job opportunities, and I really wish he had never picked up drinking again. He began working in a manual labor job, where every worker around him was smoking cigarettes and drinking, so he picked up both habits again. He justified it because he was stressed.\n\nFast forward to now, he’s been working six months at a rehab facility which has helped him with being sober. He used to be an ABA therapist, and due to saving for our wedding and honeymoon, he wants to return to that job because it pays a bit better and he has a great relationship with his past employer. Additionally, the management at his current position has been having difficulties keeping people employed, so working at the rehab facility has been difficult for him.\n\nLast night we went out to dinner with friends of ours. They drink, and we’ve been around them before while they drink and it’s typically not a problem for us. He kept telling our friends he had such a stressful week, and they scheduled him to work a Saturday for the first time, and he wasn’t looking forward to it. He said he felt like he deserved a glass of wine because he’s been so stressed this week. Privately, beforehand, I told him I would be disappointed if he decided to drink tonight when he first brought it up. We’re six months into sobriety and I said yes to marrying a sober man.\n\nHe brought it up again at the table and asked for a glass when the waiter brought out wine. I felt devastated there and the whole table could tell, and the entire situation was awkward. He broke the tension saying, “she doesn’t like it when I drink.” And I said, “yes, he has been very mean to me while drinking, and I don’t like to be around him when he drinks.” The rest of the dinner felt so awkward, but he gave his glass to our friend sitting by him and didn’t drink. I felt so much relief when he did that.\n\nAfter dinner in the car, he was so upset with me. He said he felt like I was trying to control every aspect of his life (I recently asked for his location because his phone died on the road and I couldn’t get a hold of him, and I panicked because I thought something bad had happened). I asked him why he would want to start doing something again that has harmed not only our relationship but his entire life?\n\nHe woke up today, apologizing for last night. I feel numb, and afraid that this is going to be the rest of my life, being the bad guy wanting to steal all the fun out of my fiancés life. I’m torn.

Thank you so much to each and every one of you who read my story, and to those of you who commented your congrats, hell yeah’s, and shared your stories with me. I wish I could reply to all of you directly, and learn about each of your own journeys. \n\nYesterday was so difficult for me, and writing has always been an outlet for myself to channel how I feel into something tangible. I had no idea it would blow up this much, so truly, thank you. This morning, I woke up thirsty… for water. And happy, for my success.\n\nAlcohol is a liar, alcohol will take, alcohol will shatter. Sobriety is truth, sobriety will give, sobriety will mend.\n\nIWNDWYT.\n\n——————————————————————————\n\nI\'m at 41 days sans drinking alcohol, and the ball had finally dropped, today was going to be my first party without alcohol. My uncle was in town and invited me to a pool party with his friends. Then, the anticipation set in. The night before, I was anxious, fidgety, trying to figure out what punchy-funny line I would say to explain why I wasn\'t drinking. I told my uncle the night before, so I could prepare myself for the conversation. *Okay, he\'s going to ask... think of what you\'re going to say, it\'ll be fine.* I really wondered, would this be what it\'s going to be like forever? Constantly stressing about how I\'ll be perceived? (Spoiler alert, by the drive home, I was elated.)\n\nI arrived, in tow, a sparkling water, and a lemonade can, just in case they didn\'t have anything aside from water. (Second spoiler alert, they only had water... and alcohol.) I caught up with my uncle about how things were with family, blah blah blah, knowing the question was coming. So, I decided to be transparent. More transparent than I had ever been with him before. He seemed fairly shocked, talked with me about the family history of alcohol abuse, and listened closely. So far, so good. Then... I finished both of my beverages.\n\nI managed to stay away from the first round of shots by being in the pool. I managed to stay away from the second round by making an excuse to use the bathroom. Then, it was like it happened all at once. People started bringing out copper mugs with lime and regret. They started excitedly talking about their favorite shot flavors.\n\n"Apple pie!," said my uncle\'s slurring friend. A shout from the suddenly 5 octaves higher burly man beside, "No, no, tequila!" said the aptly named, "Tequila Ted."\n\n"No, no, you guys it\'s this **amazing** banana-creme you *have* to all try!" Said my uncle\'s friends\' son. So there he went, into the house to grab it. By this point, I was jittery. I pulled out my phone to scroll absent-mindedly on my apps, praying that I didn\'t look obvious, that they couldn\'t tell that my answer to their question was on the tip of my tongue. The ping-patter of shot glasses clinging together was right beside me, as the tiny shots were placed onto the table, directly across from me.\n\n"No... I\'m not having one." I didn\'t make eye-contact. I couldn\'t do it. I kept scrolling, I texted my friend, I checked my social media, anything I could do in that moment. Tequila Ted asked me to pass him his shot. I did so, smiling, laughing, hoping that I was masking how f\\*cking weak I felt in this moment.\n\nThey took the shots, cheering, slurring, yelling, burping. I finally put my phone down. I made up an excuse to my uncle for me to leave. (I should\'ve done it 20 minutes before, but oh well.)\n\nI got to my car, shoved some music on the aux, and drove down the highway. It took about 10 minutes or so... but then it finally hit me.\n\n**I did it. I f\\*cking did it. I didn\'t drink the alcohol.** I was driving home sober. I was driving home happy. I was driving home *safe.* I know the days ahead will have moments like this, that this will get easier (I hope.) But in this moment, **I am proud.

Restrictions, which are similar to those imposed in Port Augusta and Whyalla, limited the sale of various takeaway liquor.\n\nA  special state government safety body, which endorsed the ban extension,  last week heard how city anti-social behaviour was still a “big  problem”, particularly around the Adelaide Railway Station on North Tce. Senior officers told the Safety and Wellbeing Taskforce that  numerous calls were “needing police attention” despite early results  showing restrictions maybe working. Police, who have boosted  patrols to troubled hot spots through Operation Paragon, and bureaucrats have further heard how security guards at a popular city pub were assaulted in consecutive days in the past fortnight. \n\nReported problems involve indigenous groups, record levels of  homeless people suffering through the cost of living crisis, significant  mental health issues and drunken revellers.

Since this is the first time for both of us living on our own, my parents offered that they will pay for our fridge. \n\nMy parents own a rather expensive fridge that has a built in ice cube dispenser. For the lack of better suggestions from my gf, I decided I want exactly the same fridge as my parents for our apartment. My girlfriend however was against it because in her opinion extras like the ice cube dispenser are a waste of money and it would be rude to ask my parents to pay for it. She said we should know our place and go for something more modest and that she wouldn’t use the ice cube dispenser anyway (if I want cold drinks I should just put my drink in the fridge beforehand). She never said what kind of fridge she would like though and so in the end she dropped it and my parents bought us the expensive fridge when we moved in. \n\nIt’s been a while now and I frequently use the ice cube dispenser while she just keeps all her drinks in the fridge and takes up loads of space, so yesterday when I tried to fit in other groceries I bought, I took out all her drinks so she will have to use the ice cube dispenser now if she wants a cold drink.

Probably I'm just not used to the food, but I decided to back out last minute. The night before, my husband is chatting with the guys about what to bring and he says he will be stopping at the store on the way in the morning.\n\nCut to the next day, I don't see anyone til after the excursion. They have a great time but my husband comes back totally beat. Hungry, thirsty etc. He explains that no one brought anything to drink or eat for the 4 hour trip. It was 10am-2pm and no one brought a cooler much less water. Yes WATER. I asked if he stopped at the store and he said they weren't open at the time. It was a Sunday morning and in Spain stores open pretty late or close on Sundays. We are the only foreigners and don't have a cooler, kitchen or fridge to bring stuff. It seems he was expecting everyone to bring food or drinks. \n\nMy question is, is this normal? I'm from the south and the idea of inviting a guest out on a trip and not bringing food would literally make me whither and die.  Also I have never been anywhere near water, including a backyard pool, that wasn't fully stocked with alcohol, food and anything in-between. I also have no idea why people wanna go on a boat without at least water. Even if they don't drink alcohol. \n\nI asked if there was a no cooler policy and he said no. Is this just a major fuck up on the hosts or is this a cultural thing? Has anyone been in this situation before? Also I'm glad I didn't go cause I would have been hungry. \n\nTldr, friends invited us on a boat, none of the 6 people who went brought anything including water.

Engaged 18 months. Wedding planned for 2023\r  \nJim: Married? at least one kid \n\n**Monday:** Lee goes out for drinks with workmates as Jim is visiting our city. Lee came home at midnight reasonably drunk. Says she might go out again tomorrow night before Jim leaves. \r  \n\n\n**Tuesday** Lee goes out for drinks with workmates again. Made a few comments about how it was crazy to be going out drinking again. \n\n**Text Messages/Phone calls** \n\n**Lee: 9pm:** "I\'ll be home before midnight." "We got a free shot cos I told them it was Jim\'s birthday lmao"   \n**Lee:** 11.34pm: "lol babes I\'m still out wtf". "I plan on leaving semi soon"   \n**Me:** 12:43am "Just tell me when you\'re heading home lol"  \n**Me:** 1.05am "Are you still alive?"   \n**Lee:** 1.16am: "I dunno, it\'s just having convos about dumb shit and I can\'t extract myself". "But I\'m loving it". "Soz babes"   \n\n\n**Wednesday** **4.24am**\r  \nI wake up and see Lee wasn\'t home. I call her. No answerI message her. \n\n**Me 4.24am** "Babe what are you doing?".   \n**Me 4.26am** "You need to communicate what you\'re doing". "Lee this is really weird. Where are you should I be worried and trying to call your work friends?" \n\nI realize something is wrong. We use a location tracking app when we leave home for a lengthy period by ourselves. I checked the app and could see Lee had moved about 2km from the bar near her workplace to the market area of the city. \n\n\r  \nI became extremely worried and started calling Lee continuously. After 10 calls she answers.\n\n\r  \n**Me:** "Hello, where are you?"   \n**Lee:** "(slurring) I dunno where are you?"   \n**Me:** "What!?! It\'s 4.30am on a Tuesday (Wednesday) why aren\'t you home?"   \n**Lee:** \\*Crumpled noises then disconnection   \n\n\nNow I\'m thinking something is seriously wrong. The current location on the tracking app shows Lee\'s phone to be in the middle of a lot of buildings near the markets. I think she might be passed out on a park bench, or that something worse may have happened to her. \n\n\rI grab the keys, get in the car and start driving 20 minutes to Lee\'s location. During the drive I\'m calling Lee continuously. \n\n\rAfter 15 minutes of calling, Lee answers the phone. \n\n**Me:** "where are you?"   \n**Lee:** "I dunno"   \n**Me:** "I\'m coming to get you. I can see your location on the app. What have you been doing?"   \n**Lee:** "I dunno. You don\'t need to get me. I\'m ok"   \n\n\nI drive to the market area and park at the location from the app, worried that I might find her hurt or worse. I call her again.   \n\n\n**Me:** "Where are you"   \n**Lee:** "At the McDonalds on Bean street"   \n\n\nI can\'t see any McDonalds and the street is dark at 5am. I find Bean street McD\'s with maps and call Lee again. She comes outside and get\'s in the car.\n\n**Me:** "What happened tonight, where have you been? I was so worried about you"   \n**Lee:** "I dunno"   \n**Me:** "Waddaya you mean you don\'t know? That\'s impossible? are you OK? Where have you been? What happened tonight? Do we need to go to ER and do a test for spiked drinks or worse?"   \n**Lee:** "To tell you the truth I think I was asleep" Me: "What!? At McDonalds?" Lee: "Yeah I think McDonalds. I\'m Ok though" \n\nWe then drive home arguing about whether she needs to go to hospital or not. Wednesday: Lee stays in bed. I get her KFC and other hangover remedies. She says she\'s a bit hungover, but not too bad. \r  \nI ask her what happened last night. Se says she doesn\'t remember and must have gotten too drunk. Her last memory is roughly when we messaged at 1am. She doesn\'t feel too sick and doesn\'t think her drink was spiked.\n\n\r  \nI say it\'s scary she ended up that drunk and alone. She shouldn\'t have been that wasted and her friends should have made sure she was OK. \n\n\r  \nI ask her to talk to her friends at work tomorrow to find out what happened that night. She spends most of the day in bed hungover. \n\n**Thursday** \n\nLee talks to her friends from work about Tuesday night. Apparently after the bar she walked 2km with workmate Jim to his hotel in the quieter part of the city. She says this was probably to get another drink, as the bar they were at was closing, but she isn\'t sure, she doesn\'t remember anything. I break down when I realize she was actually at Jim\'s apartment. For the first time I start to worry about her faithfulness. \n\nNumerous arguments from here on. \n\n**Friday:** \n\nI find out "workmates" actually means Jim and one other person, who left at 8pm. Lee spent 12 hours drinking with Jim, 9 of which were alone and then ended with her asleep in his apartment. After:\n\n\r  \nLee says she doesn\'t know what happened, but she is 100% sure she didn\'t cheat. I\'ve asked her and she says this includes kissing, cuddling or anything bad that I may think of. She says she remembers sitting in the apartment watching TV and nothing after that.\n\n\r  \nWhen asked about why she was in McDonalds she has no answer.\n\n\r  \n**Notes:**\r  \nLee blacks out when she drinks a large amount. I\'ve personally experienced her doing this. \r  \nI\'ve never seen Lee drink or want to stay out after 12pm. \n\n\r  \nLee is die hard about going home early and not having a late night. In the 11 years we have been together she has never wanted to be awake past 12pm. Not once If we are at an event past 12am she will continually complain about the time and her bed time. This is occasionally another issue in our relationship.\n\n\r  \nWhy move from Jim\'s hotel to McDonalds when I was arriving to pick her up? McDonalds was not visible/hard to find when I arrived at her previous location at the hotel. \n\n\r  \nWhy go to Jim\'s hotel at all? They were in the busiest part of the city. Jim\'s hotel is in the outskirts. there should be many open bars in that part of the city. \n\n\r  \nI am jealous by nature and need to check myself. This event is completely out of character for Lee. I\'m currently staying with a friend. I\'m unsure what to do or think. Did she cheat or come close enough that it doesn\'t matter?\r  \n\r', 't2_t15rokt0', 'My (34m) Fiancé (30f) disappeared after drinks with workmates.

Not even with a child?”. I chuckled awkwardly and changed the topic. She pushed the glass to me about 20 minutes later and asked if I wanted more, to which I replied “no thanks”. \n\nWhile we were cleaning up after dinner, she asked if I really had to make her son feel dirty. I looked at her confused and asked how exactly I made her son feel anything? He’s 2. It’s not like he’ll know I didn’t finish my drink just because he drank from my glass. She just shrugged and said it’s rude to be so inflexible about such minor things. I was so exhausted and sleepy at this point that I didn’t even bother try argue or explain myself tbh.

Sat down and cracked open a tinny without thinking about it. A few sips in, he taps me and politely asks me if it’d be okay if I didn’t drink. I ask why (note that where I am, drinking on public transport is perfectly legal – unsure if this is the case everywhere) and he says that he can’t be in the presence of anyone drinking alcohol. \n\nI have a think, and a quick look around to see if there are any free seats, but alas there are none. I apologise and say that I won’t be on the train for too many stops but I’d like to have my drink. He begrudgingly accepts, turns his back to me, and I have my two small cans before getting off. \n\nSo what do you think? And problems with what I did? Or perhaps it would have been better if I only had the initial drink I’d already opened and nothing else?\n\nEDIT: Some FAQs – while he didn’t explicitly tell me he was Muslim he was dressed in the full gear of an imam so I can pretty safely assume he was. He was also white. It is possible there are other reasons he couldn’t be around alcohol (potentially a former alcoholic) but this didn’t cross my mind at the time, nor did it before I read some of your comments. Mind you, his tone and a subtle gesture to demonstrate his outfit indicated to me it was about religion, but I could well have misread this.\n\nIncident happened entirely in England, although the train had originally come from Scotland (may be unimportant – but I’m Scottish and the man in question was English). Perhaps more important – drinking on the train is illegal in Scotland, but not in England.\n\nEDIT (2): One of the best points I’ve heard from a friend was that the guy was white and English, meaning that he was quite possibly not raised a Muslim and may not be as intimately familiar with Islamic law around alcohol, and/or he may have turned to Islam recently after struggling with something such as alcoholism.

So I am in a friend’s wedding next month. Recently we had her bachelorette party in another city. 9 out of 11 bridesmaids went, plus the bride. I only knew the bride (high school friend). All the other girls knew each other from college/work friends. I don’t live by any of them.\n\n\nWe all flew/drove far to Bach. A few girls (bride included) flew to a different city airport and drove to our destination, since it was cheaper for them. It was too difficult for me to try to coordinate times so I just flew into the city of the Bach and ubered to and from airport. (Cost was similar for me). \n\n\nWe used Splitwise to tally all expenses. Everything was split equally. First, I shit you not, these girls spent over $700 on groceries/alcohol for Thursday-Sunday. All while ordering $130 worth of food for Thursday night (that i arrived late to and had to eat cold leftovers). Then we all ate out for two meals friday and one meal Saturday. What the hell they spent that money on, I don’t know. A few bottles of wine that I didn’t drink from because they finished it Thursday night? They also split decorations cost, about $250. In my experience that’s usually the job of the MOH. She did nothing extra btw, but she got o share the biggest room with a private bathroom with the bride.\n\nBut whatever, I wasn’t going to make a fuss. What pissed me off was when they included me in the split for the rental car they used, claiming it as a “house expense” since it was used to get groceries and alcohol. Um, if this car was available, why was i stuck spending $100 on Ubers to/from airport??? We also did not use it to go downtown, we ubered from air bnb. \n\nAnyways, I’m pissed, and I’m hosting all these girls day of wedding at my house. I spent probably $1200 on this Bach (was really only anticipating $800 since I don’t eat much on vacation). I am obviously getting food and drinks for day of wedding and decorations for my house. Would it be bad if I asked the other girls to split the cost? I feel embarrassed even thinking about it (when you host, you provide- that’s how I do it). I can afford the food and stuff, but since these girls want to split everything so equally, I’m tempted to split that with them.\n\nWIBTA if I sent them requests for cost of food/drinks/decorations for things I buy for day of wedding?\n\nEDIT/UPDATE: I got a decent mix of responses between NTA, YTA, and ESH. I feel like half of the NTA people are just as petty as I am and i love you all for it 😂\n\nWith that being said, some of the YTA emphasized that because I changed my intentions purely because I was pissed, that’s what put me into AH territory. So I am more than likely going to go with my original plan and just host everyone and not ask for a dime. At the end of the day, the couple hundred dollars I’ll be out won’t break the bank for me, and I do want it to be a special day for the bride and not cause unnecessary stress. However, if anyone offers to venmo me to help cover cost, I won’t say no (before this situation i would’ve been like absolutely not).

Almost 5 months of sobriety got messed up tonight due to someone else’s careless mistake.\n\n**TLDR:** I got served 2 alcoholic beers even though I ordered a nonalcoholic beer at a company dinner and I’m pretty sad about it.\n\n**Long story:**I’m staying with my company but moving across the country so my manager organized a send-off dinner to celebrate. We went to a large restaurant downtown, where we’ve always gone for corporate events. It’s an Italian place with a small selection of “spirit free” beverages. Usually I order the sour nonalcoholic beer but tonight I wanted to try the Peroni 0.0, so I pointed to the menu to the beer and ordered “the nonalcoholic Peroni.”\n\nWell, the staff messed up almost every order tonight. We ordered the prosciutto appetizer and they brought a prosciutto pizza. They brought a cider to the table that nobody ordered. They originally brought me a mocktail that I didn’t order, so I told them I ordered “the Peroni”. They brought it out in a Peroni Nastro Azzuro glass. I felt a little fuzzy after the first one but I honestly thought it was placebo effect or just a reaction to the fake beer (I might be sensitive to wheat?)\n\nI ordered another and halfway through went to the bathroom. I felt way too fuzzy, a bit panicky, my eyes were dry and my nose was starting to get plugged up. I left the bathroom and went up to the waitress (she was at the bar.) I asked if she could confirm that she’d been serving me the non-alcoholic Peroni and she said she had been serving me the alcoholic one. “We have the regular and the double zero, and I’ve been bringing you the regular,” she said.\n\nHonestly I was so shaken up and almost burst into tears. I couldn’t believe it. Why would they have two kinds of the same brand of beer and NOT confirm orders with people?! I told her I ordered the non alcoholic version, and she apologized and asked if I was okay. What was I supposed to say to that? I said, “not really, and I’m super disappointed.”\n\nWhat if I had been pregnant?? What if what if what if. Honestly the what ifs don’t even matter. And to have this happen during a work event when I’m already in a really intense time of life (getting ready for a huge move.) It’s incredibly frustrating and disappointing, and I’m really sad. My sobriety has been a point of pride for me since I stopped drinking on January 1.\n\nI’m not starting my count over because I didn’t do this to myself. I did not decide to drink. But I guess I’m not ordering alcohol-free beer anymore unless I see the can myself. In the meantime I’m trying not to feel super anxious and taking many deep breaths. :(\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(Edited for formatting)', 't2_3morxv7s', "Served alcoholic beer and didn't realize it until 1.5 drinks in", 't3_13q71p6', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/13q71p6/served_alcoholic_beer_and_didnt_realize_it_until/')

There is currently a planned protest across [hundreds of subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/) to black out on June 12th. The moderators at /r/cocktails have been discussing our participation, and while we’ve come to a vote and agreement internally, we wanted to ensure that whatever action we take is largely supported by our community.\n\n\n#What’s Happening\n\n* Third Party reddit apps (such as Apollo, Reddit is Fun and others) are going to become ludicrously more expensive for it’s developers to run, which will in turn either kill the apps, or result in a monthly fee to the users if they choose to use one of those apps to browse. Put simply, each request to reddit within these mobile apps will cost the developer money. The developers of Apollo were quoted around $2 million per month for the current rate of usage. The only way for these apps to continue to be viable for the developer is if you (the user) pay a monthly fee, and realistically, this is most likely going to just outright kill them. Put simply: If you use a third party app to browse reddit, you will most likely no longer be able to do so, or be charged a monthly fee to keep it viable.\n\n* NSFW Content is no longer going to be available in the API. This means that, even if 3rd party apps continue to survive, or even if you pay a fee to use a 3rd party app, you will not be able to access NSFW content on it. You will only be able to access it on the official reddit app. Additionally, some service bots (such as video downloaders or maybe remindme bots) will not be able to access anything NSFW. In more major cases, it may become harder for moderators of NSFW subreddits to combat serious violations such as CSAM due to certain mod tools being restricted from accessing NSFW content.\n\n* Many users with visual impairments rely on 3rd-party applications in order to more easily interface with reddit, as the official reddit mobile app does not have robust support for visually-impaired users. This means that a great deal of visually-impaired redditors will no longer be able to access the site in the assisted fashion they’re used to.\n\n* Many moderators rely on 3rd-party tools in order to effectively moderate their communities. When the changes to the API kicks in, moderation across the board will not only become more difficult, but it will result in lower consistency, longer wait times on post approvals and reports, and much more spam/bot activity getting through the cracks. In discussions with mods on many subreddits, many longtime moderators will simply leave the site. While it’s tradition for redditors to dunk on moderators, the truth is that they do an insane amount of work for free, and the entire site would drastically decrease in quality and usability without them.\n\n\n#Open Letter to reddit &amp; Blackout\n\nIn light of what’s happening above, an [open letter has been released](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/13xh1e7/an_open_letter_on_the_state_of_affairs_regarding/) by the broader moderation community, and /r/cocktails will be supporting it. Part of this initiative includes a potential subreddit blackout (meaning the subreddit will be privatized) on June 12th, lasting 48 hours or longer.\n\n----\n\nWe welcome your thoughts to this event, and we understand that this will likely impact your daily imbibes and inspirations, but these kind of changes, and moreover the way they are being rolled out are antithetical to the foundations of reddit communities and how they have been built over time.', 't2_3h091', "/r/cocktails will join the blackout on June 12-14th to protest Reddit's API pricing changes - what does this mean for you", 't3_141toaz', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/141toaz/rcocktails_will_join_the_blackout_on_june_1214th/')

I wasn’t optimistic about this app either but figured it was worth a shot. \n          B was one of the first guys I matched with. I was initially attracted to how cute he was and his profile fit what we were looking for. The conversation flowed easily, he did a great job of asking about boundaries, turns on, hard no’s, etc. His messages were respectful but filthy, a perverted gentleman, just my type. After several weeks of talking, flirting, sexting we agreed to meet up (the sexual tension was through the roof by this point). I was nervous but didn’t think it would actually happen so I didn’t think about it to much. I reserved an Airbnb and focused on what I was going to wear.  I chose a black lace crotchless bodysuit to wear underneath my black leather leggings and a silky tank top. \n          We agreed to meet at a local arcade bar. I started to get nervous when I realized B was actually going to show up. It was a little awkward at first. My husband encouraged us to walk off on our own to get to know each other. I felt more at ease knowing he was close by but having the space to get to know B alone helped with the awkwardness. I chuckled to myself when I overheard my husband tell B to feel free to get a little handsy. It started with a light touch across my lower back, lightly touching my butt and resting his hand on my hip while I was playing a game. It’s funny how the lightest touch can turn you on when it’s coming from someone you just met. \n          One section of the bar had pinball machines tucked back in a corner room. It was the closest thing you could get to complete privacy in public. It worked out pretty well to test our chemistry, a little to well actually. I was playing a game and B was standing behind me. He ran his hands across my butt and then up and down my hips. It was in that moment I knew I’d fuck him later. I started to push back grinding against him. He slid his hands under my shirt and up my sides brushing against my breast. Feeling his fingers touch my bare skin really had me wanting to get out of there. He started rubbing my pussy through my leggings. My leggings were thin and so was my thong, I felt everything. I reached back and started rubbing his cock through his pants. My husband was beside us watching the whole encounter, which made it even hotter. We were lost in the heat of the moment and didn’t realize another couple had came into the room until they were suddenly beside us. Probably for the best because we were getting a little carried away for being in public. \n          B went to the bathroom and I let my husband know I’d be ready to go after our drink. We played a few more games and fooled around a little more while we finished our drinks. B kept touching me trying to distract me while I was playing a game while my husband looked on and kept encouraging it. \n          We made our way to the apartment we had rented for the night. We went in and made drinks. B sat beside me on the couch and started rubbing my inner thigh and was trying to peek at the lingerie he knew I was wearing. I was aching to feel his fingers inside of me. We started kissing, next thing I know his fingers are sliding inside my leggings and moving my thong to the side. He curled his fingers inside of me and started doing that come here motion that drives me wild. My husband stood watching and told me to take off my pants and underwear. I started rubbing B through his shorts. All the teasing and touching had me desperate to wrap my lips around him.  I undid his belt and unzipped his shorts. I grabbed his cock and stroked it a bit before I took him in my mouth as deep as I could. We continued to fool around like that until he broke the silence and said “why don’t we go to the bedroom so you can sit on my face.” \n          We went to the bedroom and did 69 for awhile. My husband continued to watch and record some. I took a few breaks from sucking B’s cock to rub and suck my husbands cock. B moved down between my legs and started licking my pussy. Then he started fingering me at the same time. He wasn’t lying when he said he had a magical tongue and fingers, the way he moved them made me want to stay there all night. \n          I wanted him inside of me but not before I teased him first. He hovered over me while I rubbed his cock up and down my pussy. When he called me a tease it just encouraged me to keep doing it. During our talks he told me he wanted me to tease him but I don’t think he realized just how much self control I have. I finally let him slide his dick in me. He fucked me hard for a bit and then slower while we made out. Then he put my legs on his shoulder and fucked me hard. When he needed a break I rode him. At one point he ripped my lingerie so he could rub and spank my ass. I gave him head and stroked his cock while my husband ripped my lingerie the rest of the way and fucked me from behind. I slowly stroked his cock and alternated rhythms prolonging his orgasm as long as I could.  I enjoyed making him wait to cum. I stroked him until he shot cum all over my tits.  \n          My pussy is sore and my muscles ache, it’s a constant reminder and I start to get wet every time I think about it. Not much has changed although I can add “looking for hotel rooms with good mood lighting and the right furniture set up for porn shoots” to my list of hobbies now.\n          There’s just one lingering question…..when do I get to do it again?\n\n*If you made it this far feel free to comment (NOT DM) and ask me anything.', 't2_im2u6epi', 'Cocktails and Cocks-The Slutty Confessions of Cherry Lane', 't3_1471p7y', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/SluttyConfessions/comments/1471p7y/cocktails_and_cocksthe_slutty_confessions_of/')

It was a labor of love; it took muuuuuch longer than usual to edit because I created a full 15-minute track purely of blowjob sounds that I gathered from some talented and generous VAs (listed below). It was probably overambitious, but I really wanted to create a feeling &amp; vibe so I felt like the ambiance mattered a lot. I also curated some royalty-free music and "scored" this audio too lol &lt;33 PLEASE ENJOY. \n\n**Summary:** *You\'ve heard about the blowjob bar but never visited for yourself. After a long day of work, you decide to give it a shot. You do not expect to see dozens of women giving blowjobs as soon as you walk in, but you like it nonetheless. The bar\'s owner gives you a quick rundown on what to expect before she introduces you to the new girl, Elle. Elle is super sweet and loves deepthroating cock, but she does not like to follow the rules. The owner gives you just one rule to follow, specifically emphasizing that it may be difficult: "Whatever you do, do NOT fuck Elle! The girls are only to serve you orally." You don\'t think you\'ll have any problem abiding by this rule, but then you meet her...*\n\n**Credits:** HUGEEEE shout out to those who lent me their glorious blowjob sounds to create that wet sloppy ambiance! they are: u/Audio_Allure, u/beegeewanders, u/Daisy4Dayz, u/lucyddreamwithme, u/lunarhiccups, u/redhairedmilf, u/SnakeySmut, u/v_silvermoon and me!!\n\n[**Artwork**](https://imgur.com/a/pVm13pp)**:** kinkyqueen13 | **Music:** southstreet24 \n\nimprov, editing, and voice by me &lt;3  \nenjoy!!!! 💜\n\n**Disclaimer:** EVERYONE PORTRAYED IS 18+.

We spent four years as friends and two years as a couple. We got engaged relatively quick (6 months) after becoming a couple. I felt comfortable getting engaged because we were friends for so long and he was very loving and attentive. I share a connection with him that I have never felt with anyone else.\n\nWe are long distance. We live in two separate countries which comes with its own challenges. There are at times cultural and age differences that so far we have been able to work through.  \n\nI went through a devastating loss last year. I have been struggling emotionally and most of the time do not feel that my partner is understanding of my grief and how much it has be l been affecting my everyday life, despite me telling him this. I suffered another loss last week and my emotions have been on a rollercoaster.\n\nYesterday I asked him if he could spend some time with me on the phone because I needed the emotional support. He agreed, but said that he would only give me one or two hours of his time because we was planning on going out to a bar with friends. (In his culture and friends group, when people go out the point is to get inebriated. There is no in between or just one drink for them.) I have addressed to him that this is a problem for me because he becomes aggressive verbally and belligerent when he is drunk. We have been planning on starting a family relatively soon so I am concerned about his drinking while I am pregnant or while raising the child as well.  That is not to say that he is an alcoholic, just that his current environment encourages binge drinking and he is not a person that handles his liquor well.\n\nEventually he agreed to tell his friends that he was going to stay home and be with me instead of going out. However, I noticed that he had two beers. Knowing that he does not handle his liquor well and that he in fact does change his demeanor even after two drinks, I asked him if he could not drink because I wanted to talk and not emotionally stable and needed him clear headed. He started to argue with me and told me that he was already doing me a favor by not going out with his friends.\n\nThis irritated me as he should want to be there to support his partner and I was not asking him to give me a kidney, just to be sober for our conversation because I know how he when he drinks already.  Out of view from the camera, I hear him opening another can of beer but trying to conceal it from me.  I bring it up to him that I know what he is doing and that I already asked home if he could stop drinking. He again began to argue with me and said that I was trying to control him and that I should mind my business.  Honestly his behavior has me concerned on how our marriage will be and how he will be with raising our possible children. Will he choose a night out with friends instead of staying home with me and a sick kid when I need help?\n\nOur conversation ended with me telling him that he was choosing alcohol over me and our relationship. That I was disappointed that he was refusing to be there for me emotionally as I have been there forever him our entire relationship. I said that if he wanted to continue drinking that I don’t want to be married to someone that inconsiderate and that the engagement is over.  \n\nReflecting now, I am wondering if I overreacted?\n\nEdit: I lost my sister who was only one year older than me and my grandmother\n\nThank you everyone for your input! I’m going to try to stay firm on my decision and focus on myself and my grief.

The most recent time was because my sis wanted to do a wine tasting while we were on a trip together. \n\nAt the winery, I found the first wine that I’ve actually enthusiastically liked: a spicy wine infused with hot peppers. I bought a bottle, took it home, and put it in my section of the shared pantry. \n\nA couple of months went by without incident. Then one Friday night, I came home to Morgan and two of her friends drinking it. I confronted her about it, and she said that her friend had opened it without knowing it was mine. Morgan apparently realized the mistake but thought it would be ok because I’ve “said that I don’t like wine before.” \n\n??? What makes you think that made it ok? Ive said that before, yes, but this is literally the only wine I’ve ever enjoyed enough to buy a bottle of. I was saving it for a special occasion or maybe to share the next time my sister came to visit. But they drank most of it, and now there’s barely a full glass left. \n\nI told her I wanted her to replace it, and she agreed. Well, a couple weeks later she said that she’d gotten me another bottle, but it was just regular wine from the liquor store. \n\nI told her that she must have misunderstood: I don’t want just any old bottle of regular wine. I want her to get me another bottle of the actual wine that she and her friends drank.\n\nHer eyes got really wide and she started complaining about how that winery is a three hour drive away, and that wasn’t fair because it was her friend who opened it and not her.\n\nHonestly? I told her that I didn’t really care. Morgan knew it was mine and let her friends drink it anyway. She could have told her friend that it was mine, put it away, and told me about it, and I would’ve understood. But no, she let them go ahead and even poured herself a glass. She was still drinking it when I came home. \n\nSo yeah: I’ve told her that her friend can replace it or she can. Don’t really care how. I just want another bottle before the lease is up next year and I move out. \n\nMorgan is mad at me. She’s been avoiding hanging out in our shared living room and won’t speak to me at all now. Our third roommate thinks I’m being unreasonable and wants me to just drop it and accept the regular wine bottle as a replacement, so Morgan will “get back to her old self.” \n\nThey’re both making me feel really bad now, and I’m wondering if I’m being too harsh so, AITA?', 't2_94jn8u6m', 'AITA for wanting my roommate to replace my special wine that her friend opened?', 't3_13rlphd', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13rlphd/aita_for_wanting_my_roommate_to_replace_my/')

Strong wine, but oh so good\n\nNON KIRKLAND BRANDS:\n\nTreana Cabernet - this wine is just amazing for $24 a bottle. I can't say enough good things about it. It can probably compete with the ultra premium wines in the $80+ price point. Let it decant for about an hour plus and you'll thank me.\n\nWhen at costco always look for portuguese wines, portuguese wines are a safe bet.\n\nAlso look for GSM blends, they are usually pretty good for those who don't drink too much wine GSM stands for Grenache, Syrah, Mouverde.\n\nAlso Juan Gil silver label is pretty good.\n\nSpanish regions to look for: Ribiera Del Duero.\n\nI've found so many great wines at Costco over the years that i no longer buy wine anywhere else.

It was never consistent. Everyone usually had access to mids, there was always shwag. And every once in a while, the nugs would role through. Usually during the summer season, concerts, etc. You could get the best weed at tours. \n\nEverything pretty much stayed that way until legalization. I was in CO for a couple of years during their early adoption. And it happened there too - this isn't unique to Illinois. But there is a major difference between CO and IL: CO prices dropped. The average price of a pound in CO has dropped by **over 50% from 2014-2022.**\n\nLook, I know everyone has their taste, but not everyone is seeing the issues objectively. \n\nI'm going to try to use a measure to standardize the 'good' in CO v. IL by using the cannabis cup winner and the resulting cost.\n\nColorado: in 2022, Purple Monkey Face Slap won best overall flower. An 8th is $19.78. **$5.65/g**.\n\nIllinois: in 2022, Brownie Scout won best overall. An 8th is $55. **$15.71/g**.\n\nSo... is it fair to say that 'cheaper' weed in other states isn't as good? I don't buy that for a second. I've seen comment after comment saying how MI is full of mids. \n\nMichigan: in 2022,  Society C – Spritzer won best AU. An 8th is $20. **$5.71/g.**\n\nSee the pattern?\n\nI'm tired of seeing a bunch of Illinois ents act like snobs because they think dollars mean quality. It doesn't. There is absolutely *nothing* to show that high priced Illinois cannabis is justifying the price. The only missing ingredient in the mix that those people constantly ignore is: corporate greed. This is the state's fault - and the businesses for engaging in it. And it's all at the cost of the consumer. Yet, countless users here seem to think that beating the drum for these Illinois companies is somehow showing that you have 'better taste' or that 'other states weed isn't as good.' It's absolutely ridiculous.\n\nIllinois companies are *legally pillaging* consumers by inflating prices and taking advantage of the limited number of licenses. This was projected to happen from the start - and it played out exactly as we were concerned it would. \n\nI'm happy that Illinois legalized cannabis. Truly. But I'm not going to circle-jerk Illinois weed. This sub has a major issue with seeing the reality - you're part of why Illinois has little reason to change. You keep shoving money into these companies - which helps them shovel it directly to Springfield.\n\nIs there a good solution? NO! I'm not saying there is.

And in sports canteens, drinking is no longer allowed and there must be a minimum price for a drink.  \nA beer after exercise is very nice, also think young people under the age of 18. But that's not the point:  \nWith the alcolock, Van Ooijen wants to add a next chapter with policy arising from the prevention agreement. He hopes for government support. With this agreement, obesity, smoking and problematic alcohol consumption must be combated.  \nThe Rutte III cabinet already introduced restrictions in 2018, especially in the area of reducing smoking. For example, it was decided to increase the excise duty on tobacco and to remove packs of cigarettes from view in the supermarket.

The entire pressure is no more (implying that he cares a lot, but he was relieved once it was over, not that he doesnt care about it) \n\nReporter: Why were you super-mad at some point ? Was it the quick shots ? \n\nJok: Yeah, that pissed me off. We had several 3-2 or 4-3 situations ending with a quick shot, that isnt the way you take control, some of those shots were not good even with the offensive extra player and you dont do that with 4-5 points lead, you take it slow, european style \n\nJok: That\'s also the reason why I love basketball, it\'s a live game and errors are inevitable, it is the opportunity to correct your error that makes this game great \n\nReporter: you were 80% in a game full of misses, and that\'s with the heave you had, that almost went in ? \n\nJok: Did you see that ? Maaaaaan, it almost went in (super excited + bummed it didnt) \n\nJok: I didnt want to start the game super-aggressive, I didnt want to come to the game like that - I wanted the game to come to me at some point, and it paid of, but yes, everyone was missing until the end where Jimmy hit 3 shots, Jamal made one crucial, it was a game full of misses but it turned out good for us, we got the clutch shots we needed \n\nReporter: We Serbs had legendary players, but you are the first one to take the NBA ring, while being the main player of that team, and your stats are record breaking, can you expand on that ? \n\nJok: Yeah, I know players from 10, 20 years ago, I watched all of them, and I still cant say that I did something extraordinary from my own perspective - I dont want to sound cheesy, but I look at it from the perspective where you cant relax and go "I did it, Im the champ" as that will make you fall one step lower than your current state of mind, and people asked me about it and I just cant - I wont go out of the focus (of the game), Im focused still \n\nReporter: Some say, that finding yourself in this situation, may block the emotions due to the sheer road taken .. \n\nJok: (continuing) you are absolutely right, I hear the words in my mind, it\'s a first title for the Nuggets in the history, it IS something amazing, and we WILL realize it once it all settles down, the size of it all, it\'s just that I personally felt the pressure finally letting go, and I felt accordingly \n\n----------------------------------\n\nThis speaks a lot about Jokic\'s state of mind, and explains why some people mistakenly thought that Jokic doesnt care.

I was hoping to start small and and keep scope contained by just serving alcohol (even if it means aiming to break even while I figure things out). \n\nMe: I have little experience in the bar/food industries, and I\'ve read quite a few "don\'t open a bar" reddit posts to hedge profitability expectations, so I\'m trying to be mindful of biting off more than I can chew. I\'m working with about $100k in savings and could probably borrow against that amount or wait until I\'ve had more saved up from my current job.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n* Based on your experience with restaurants/bars, is the additional margin on liquor worth even entertaining selling food? Do you think that might deter customers?\n* Should this be a deal-breaker that would make me consider starting the business in another county/going back to the drawing board altogether?\n* Would this be a reasonable reason to try to partner with a local food vendor to support that function? I would like to avoid an equity partnership if I can.\n\nThanks!', 't2_gvqk8ocp', "I'm in the planning stages for a small entertainment bar.

In this post I will cover argue Joffrey\'s Chalice was almost certainly not poisoned. My argument hinges on these four points:\n\n1. The strangler takes effect immediately after Joffrey eats pigeon pie, while he\'s been drinking wine all night\n2. Tyrion is the only character with the opportunity to poison the wine, and he didn\'t\n3. Littlefinger had no motive to kill Joffrey, and many motives to kill Tyrion.\n4. Olenna would not risk Margaery\'s life by poisoning the wine chalice she was sharing with Joffrey\n\n# The Strangler\n\nLet us open this discussion by going over what we know as solid facts, starting with Maester Cressen\'s experience with the Strangler.\n\n&gt;On the bottom shelf behind a row of salves in squat clay jars he found a vial of indigo glass, no larger than his little finger. It rattled when he shook it. Cressen blew away a layer of dust and carried it back to his table. Collapsing into his chair, he pulled the stopper and spilled out the vial’s contents. A dozen crystals, no larger than seeds, rattled across the parchment he’d been reading. They shone like jewels in the candlelight, so purple that the maester found himself thinking that he had never truly seen the color before.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;He touched one of the crystals lightly with the tip of his little finger. Such a small thing to hold the power of life and death. It was made from a certain plant that grew only on the islands of the Jade Sea, half a world away. The leaves had to be aged, and soaked in a wash of limes and sugar water and certain rare spices from the Summer Isles. Afterward they could be discarded, but the potion must be thickened with ash and allowed to crystallize. The process was slow and difficult, the necessaries costly and hard to acquire. The alchemists of Lys knew the way of it, though, and the Faceless Men of Braavos . . . and the maesters of his order as well.\n\nFrom this we know that the strangler is a purple crystal, very rare and difficult to manufacture, and it is associated twice with a certain "little finger". The crystals\' descriptions match perfectly the black amethysts in the silver hair net which Littlefinger has Dontos give to Sansa in her last chapter of ACOK.\n\n&gt;Cressen no longer recalled the name the Asshai’i gave the leaf, or the Lysene poisoners the crystal. In the Citadel, it was simply called the strangler. Dissolved in wine, it would make the muscles of a man’s throat clench tighter than any fist, shutting off his windpipe. They said a victim’s face turned as purple as the little crystal seed from which his death was grown, but so too did a man choking on a morsel of food.\n\nFrom this we know that the strangler can dissolve in wine, but also that the poison\'s effects make it appear that the victim choked to death on food. Wine is not presented as the only thing the Strangler could be dissolved in, but it is the substance Cressen intends to use.\n\n&gt;In the blink of an eye, his fingers were empty. His hands had not been so steady for years, nor half so fluid. Davos saw, but no one else, he was certain. Cup in hand, he rose to his feet. “Mayhaps I have been a fool. Lady Melisandre, will you share a cup of wine with me? A cup in honor of your god, your Lord of Light? A cup to toast his power?”  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The red woman studied him. “If you wish.”  \n&gt;  \n&gt;He could feel them all watching him. Davos clutched at him as he left the bench, catching his sleeve with the fingers that Lord Stannis had shortened. “What are you doing?” he whispered.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;“A thing that must be done,” Maester Cressen answered, “for the sake of the realm, and the soul of my lord.” He shook off Davos’s hand, spilling a drop of wine on the rushes.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;She met him beneath the high table with every man’s eyes upon them. But Cressen saw only her. Red silk, red eyes, the ruby red at her throat, red lips curled in a faint smile as she put her hand atop his own, around the cup. Her skin felt hot, feverish. “It is not too late to spill the wine, Maester.”  \n&gt;  \n&gt;“No,” he whispered hoarsely. “No.”  \n&gt;  \n&gt;“As you will.” Melisandre of Asshai took the cup from his hands and drank long and deep.\n\nHere we see how quickly the strangler dissolves. Cressen is completely unconcerned with giving it time; the moment the poison is in the half-full cup he is ready to put it to use, and when Melisandre drinks it is already fully liquified. Then Cressen Drinks\n\n&gt;There was only half a swallow of wine remaining when she offered it back to him. “And now you.”  \n&gt;  \n&gt;His hands were shaking, but he made himself be strong. A maester of the Citadel must not be afraid. The wine was sour on his tongue. He let the empty cup drop from his fingers to shatter on the floor. “He does have power here, my lord,” the woman said. “And fire cleanses.” At her throat, the ruby shimmered redly.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Cressen tried to reply, but his words caught in his throat. His cough became a terrible thin whistle as he strained to suck in air. Iron fingers tightened round his neck. As he sank to his knees...\n\nHere we see how small of a dose is deadly. Mel drank all but one swallow of the wine, yet Cressen coughs immediately, and rapidly loses his speech and begins to die.\n\n# Tyrion, Joffrey, Chalice, Cream\n\nTyrion Lannister is our Point of View character for the chapter where Joffrey dies, and the primary suspect in the boy king\'s murder. What the imp sees and does not see is all we have to go off of to determine how exactly poison got from Sansa\'s hair to Joffrey\'s mouth. Let us note all of his observations of Sansa\'s hair, the wine chalice, what Joffrey eats and drinks, and how exactly he dies.\n\nPrelude: Tyrion watches Olenna play with Sansa\'s hair, for a LONG time. Olenna so very clearly is the one who steals an amethyst from Sansa\'s hair.\n\n&gt;“You do look quite exquisite, child,” Lady Olenna Tyrell told Sansa when she tottered up to them in a cloth-of-gold gown that must have weighed more than she did. “The wind has been at your hair, though.” The little old woman reached up and fussed at the loose strands, tucking them back into place and straightening Sansa’s hair net. “I was very sorry to hear about your losses,” she said as she tugged and fiddled. “Your brother was a terrible traitor, I know, but *if we start killing men at weddings they’ll be even more frightened of marriage than they are presently*. There, that’s better.” Lady Olenna smiled. “I am pleased to say I shall be leaving for Highgarden the day after next. I have had quite enough of this smelly city, thank you. *Perhaps you would like to accompany me for a little visit, whilst the men are off having their war?* I shall miss my Margaery so dreadfully, and all her lovely ladies. Your company would be such sweet solace.”  \n&gt;  \n&gt;“You are too kind, my lady,” said Sansa, “*but my place is with my lord husband*.”  \n&gt;  \n&gt;...She patted Sansa’s hair again and said, “Well, off with you, child, and try to be merrier."\n\nHowever, we should not just assume that Olenna has stolen the amethyst in order to poison Joffrey. Let\'s actually look at what she says about her motivations:\n\n* "If we start killing men at weddings they\'ll be even more frightened of marriage than they are presently"\n   * This is clearly a joke/foreshadow, since Olenna plans on killing a man at this wedding. However a sentiment rings true- she is sorry about Robb, and she doesn\'t want to be killing men at *their own* weddings.\n* "Perhaps you would like to accompany me \\[to Highgarden\\] for a little visit, whilst the men are off having their war?"... “You are too kind, my lady,” said Sansa, “*but my place is with my lord husband*.”\n   * Olenna wants to take Sansa away to Highgarden, but she cannot because Sansa\'s place is with her husband, Tyrion. In this exchange we learn that Olenna has poison, plans on using it at the wedding, and that Tyrion being married to Sansa is a problem for Olenna. Signs point towards Tyrion.\n\n1: “‘Your Grace,’ was all \\[Tyrion\\] had time to say before the king upended the chalice over his head”. If Joffrey’s wine was poisoned before now, that poison has been dumped out.\n\n2: Joffrey has no wine, Tyrion is named his cupbearer. “He claimed a flagon from a serving girl and filled the goblet three-quarters full… Joffrey took the wedding chalice one-handed, drank deep, and set it on the table.” Joffrey is fine; the serving girl did not poison the flagon she gave Tyrion.\n\n3: The pie arrives, and everyone is focused on it. The pie is cut very dramatically with Ser Illyn\'s sword, pigeons fly out, and the guests are served. “A serving man placed a slice of hot pigeon pie in front of Tyrion and covered it with a spoon of lemon cream.” If Tyrion’s pie is poisoned, it was done by the serving man and the strangler is dissolved in the spoonful of lemon cream. Neither Tyrion nor Sansa touch their pie. With everyone focused on the pie, now would be the time to poison Joffrey’s wine.\n\n4: “The king’s chalice was on the table where he’d left it… Joff yanked it from \\[Tyrion’s\\] hands and drank long and deep, his throat working as the wine ran purple down his chin.”\n\n5: ‘“My lord,” Margaery said, “we should return to our places. Lord Buckler wants to toast us.” “My uncle hasn’t eaten his pigeon pie.” Holding the chalice onehanded, Joff jammed his other into Tyrion’s pie. “It’s ill luck not to eat the pie” he scolded…”’ Joffrey took a long and deep drink, then had some conversation with his wife and uncle. If Joff’s wine was poisoned, he should have started coughing, at least, during this exchange. As a reminder, Maester Cressen didn’t manage to get a single word out after drinking poisoned wine.\n\n6: ‘... as he filled his mouth with hot spiced pigeon. “See, it’s good.” Spitting out flakes of crust, he coughed and helped himself to another fistful. “Dry, though. Needs washing down.” Joff took a swallow of wine and coughed again, more violently. “I want to see, kof, see you ride that, kof kof, pig, Uncle. I want. ..” His words broke up in a fit of coughing.’\n\nThere are two possible interpretations of point 6, one more likely than the other. Either\n\n* The pie was dry and Joffrey’s first cough was due merely to that, and his swallow of wine to wash it down is what delivered the poison, resulting in a more violent cough. *The wine was poisoned while Joffrey was holding it in his hand*, when all eyes including Tyrion’s were on him, and *neither Tyrion nor Joffrey nor Sansa noticed anyone walking up and to and putting something in the chalice*, or\n* The pie was poisoned, not just dry. This poison caused Joff’s coughing fit, which gradually escalated. Through Tyrion we saw where the poison came from, the serving man with the lemon cream.\n\nReally quickly, let\'s apply Occam\'s Razor. Joffrey and others have been drinking out of his wine goblet throughout the feast, and have been just fine. But the MOMENT Joffrey eats some of Tyrion\'s pie he begins to cough, and the dies. What is more likely: that Joffrey\'s wine just so happened to get poisoned at this very moment, out of all possible opportunities to poison it, or that the pie Joffrey eats only once, right before his death, is what poisoned him. Put simply: Joffrey has been drinking wine all night and he\'s been fine. He eats Tyrion\'s pie **once** and **immediately starts dying**.\n\n7: Let’s see what Joff thinks he’s dying from. **‘“It’s, kof, the pie, noth - kof, pie.” Joff took another drink, or tried to, but all the wine came spewing back out when another spate of coughing doubled him over.’”** The boy\'s last words were "It\'s the pie", and I think we ought to take this as a very serious hint.\n\n8: “…the boy’s eyes met Tyrion’s… Joffrey was making a dry clacking noise, trying to speak. His eyes bulged white with terror, and he lifted a hand... reaching for his uncle, or pointing…” Tyrion thinks Joffrey is either begging his forgiveness or asking for his help, but I am more inclined towards Cersei’s interpretation. Joffrey is accusing Tyrion. It was Tyrion’s pie he just ate, after all.\n\n10: “But his eyes fell on the wedding chalice, forgotten on the floor. He went and scooped it up. There was still a half-inch of deep purple wine in the bottom of it. Tyrion considered it a moment, then poured it on the floor.” What exactly was Tyrion’s consideration? This is one of the few moments in the entire series where our POV character thinks about something, but we do not hear their thoughts.\n\nConclusion: Joffrey has been drinking wine all night and he\'s been fine. He eats Tyrion\'s pie **once** and **immediately starts dying**. When somebody besides Tyrion had the opportunity to poison Joffrey’s wine, nobody did. What probably happened? Olenna took the Strangler from Sansa\'s hair net, handed it to the serving man, who dissolved it into the lemon cream which he spooned onto Tyrion\'s pie. Tyrion didn\'t touch his pie. Joffrey ate it, then Joffrey died.\n\n# Cersei’s Propaganda: Poisoned Wine, Clean Pie\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of Joffrey’s death, the witnesses do not suspect foul play from anyone present. Lady Alerie says to Margaery “He choked, sweetling. He choked on the pie. It was naught to do with you. He choked. We all saw.” The poison was delivered so as to make it appear that the victim died from choking on pie, and that is what the witnesses suspect. Like all the best poisonings, it was meant to look like it wasn’t poison. Alerie Tyrell doesn’t think this was an assassination attempt, and neither do the kingsguard who are “standing uselessly around her.” Nobody suspects foul play, nor do they suspect anyone of murder, until:\n\n&gt;“Arrest my brother,” \\[Cersei\\] commanded him. “He did this, the dwarf. Him and his little wife. They killed my son. Your king. Take them! Take them both!”\n\nCersei blames Tyrion for this, thus it must be the wine that was poisoned. If the pie was poisoned then Tyrion was the intended target and Joffrey died of his own cruelty. Tyrion’s guilt and the wine being poisoned are unified concepts, and logistically Tyrion is the only reasonable suspect to have poisoned the wine. However we know that Tyrion is innocent, which implies the wine was innocent as well.\n\nTyrion understands this. At his trial he never attempts to claim that someone else poisoned the wine, but rather asserts that “Joffrey choked on his pigeon pie.” It\'s obvious to him that nobody but himself could have poisoned the wine, so he accuses no one of doing so, and rather points to the pie as the cause of death. This phraseology is also an intentional misdirect from GRRM: the deadly dish is repeatedly referred to as "His" or "Joffrey\'s pigeon pie", and never as Tyrion\'s, so we the reader as well as the characters can easily forget the possibility that Tyrion was the intneded target.\n\nBecause of Cersei’s accusation, Tyrion’s trial only considers wine-based murder possibilities: Tyrion poisoned the wine, or somebody else did. Since Tyrion cannot prove that he didn\'t poison the wine, nobody needs consider that something else may have been poisoned.\n\nIt was Meryn Trant who finally answered. “He filled Joffrey’s cup with wine. That must have been when he slipped the poison in.”\n\n&gt;“You are certain it was the wine that was poisoned?”  \n&gt;  \n&gt;“What else?” said Ser Boros Blount. “The Imp emptied the dregs on the floor. Why, but to spill the wine that might have proved him guilty?”\n\nThe pie, and any other poison possibilities, are forgotten with the assumption of Tyrion\'s guilt.\n\nI believe that Cersei’s accusation of Tyrion (even though we the audience know it to be false) is the core reason that most readers believe that Joffrey’s wine was poisoned. All of the characters who take Tyrion’s guilt for granted are directly influenced by Cersei, except for the Tyrells. Since Olenna wants Tyrion dead, she is of course more than happy to jump onto Cersei\'s frame job and support Mace\'s fury that the wine was poisoned and may have killed Margaery, in the hopes that Tyrion is found guilty and killed.\n\n# Sansa and Dontos\n\nWhen Dontos gives the hair net to Sansa, he tells her that it is\n\n“Lovelier than you know, sweet child. It’s magic, you see. It’s justice you hold. It’s vengeance for your father.” Dontos leaned close and kissed her again. “It’s home.”\n\nWhoever the poison is meant for, multiple parts of this statement are a lie. It is not magic, it is poison. And it is not home, either. Littlefinger admits that this is a lie, and further says that it is HIS home he planned to take Sansa to, not her own. So what about justice, and vengeance for Sansa\'s father? If Joffrey is the target, then killing him does serve as justice and vengeance for the beheading of Eddard Stark. Of course Dontos and Littlefinger want Sansa to believe this, to ensure that she will wear the hair net to Joffrey\'s wedding feast. However, if Tyrion is the target, then justice and vengeance are yet more lies. Vengeance for Sansa\'s father? What if that statement is not targeted at Ned, but yet again Littlefinger? After acquiring Sansa, Petyr Baelish quickly styles himself as Alayne\'s father. And of course, obtaining a daughter from Catelyn is justice and vengeance for Littlefinger personally.\n\n&gt;In a better world, you might have been mine, not Eddard Stark’s. My loyal loving daughter...\n\nMoving to the day of the crime: For most of the feast Sansa is lost in melancholy mourning the deaths of her family, and Once Ser Illyn pulls out his sword to slice the pigeon pie she becomes hyper-fixated on the blade she thinks is Ice.\n\nIn the minutes leading up to Joffrey’s poisoning Sansa is not paying attention to her physical surroundings, so she is not a helpful source for determining who got their hands on the poison. Sansa clearly does not remember anyone taking an amethyst from her hair, and is willing to blame any suspect presented to her. When she meets Dontos in the godswood she blames him, and then upon learning that Tyrion has been arrested, Sansa immediately thinks its possible that Tyrion took it. Sansa is not a reliable source on her own; all we learn from her POV is what Dontos and Petyr Baelish have to say to her.\n\nDontos didn’t take the amethyst, but he did know the plan. He knew someone was going to die at that wedding, and he knew it was the pie that was poisoned. Dontos gives us proof that the assassination was intended to look like death by pie:\n\n&gt;“Black amethysts,” he swore. “There was magic in them.”  \n“There was murder in them!”  \n“Softly, my lady, softly. No murder. He choked on his pigeon pie.” Dontos chortled. “Oh, tasty tasty pie. Silver and stones, that’s all it was, silver and stone and magic.”\n\nDontos has no way of knowing by observation of Joffrey’s death whether the poison was in his pie or his wine. However, unlike our other bystanders, Dontos knows for a FACT that there was poison (or death magic, if we grant him his style). Since Dontos’ story here is that Joffrey choked on his pie, he clearly knew beforehand that the poison was meant to be in the pie.\n\nDontos does raise one problem, however: If he knew that the poison was meant for Tyrion, and that they got the wrong guy, why wouldn’t he mention that to Sansa? I posit this simple solution: **Dontos did not know who the target was**. And why would he? Littlefinger only trusts him as far as the promise of 10,000 gold dragons can take him. If Dontos knew that the target was King Joffrey, or the Lannister Master of Coin, and had a whole moon turn to consider his options, he may well have considered outing the conspiracy as the more safe and more profitable alternative. The only faction who could potentially match Littlefinger’s 10,000 gold offer would be the Lannisters, after all.\n\nWith this in mind I think it is totally reasonable that Littlefinger only told Dontos that there would be a death at Joffrey’s wedding (so he wouldn’t be caught off-guard), that Sansa’s hair net was full of vengeance magic (to make sure he convinced her to wear it), and that the pigeon pie would be poisoned (so he would make sure Sansa didn’t eat any of it). With this information Ser Dontos knows everything he needs to be on time for the job and to keep Sansa safe, but cannot blab to anybody about the target.\n\nSpeaking of Littlefinger and what he did and did not tell people, let’s examine his plan and whether or not it makes more sense if he had intended to kill Tyrion:\n\n# Littlefinger had a Motive\n\nLet’s look at what we know Petyr Baelish wanted out of the Purple Wedding:\n\n1. He wants to obtain Sansa, without anyone knowing he wanted or had her.\n2. He wants Sansa to trust and be solely dependent on himself.\n3. He wants Sansa to be unmarried so he can use her politically. “Widowhood will become you, Sansa.”\n4. He doesn’t want anyone to suspect him of the murder.\n\nSo let’s look at what he gets out of Joffrey’s death:\n\n1. Check. He gets Sansa, and Olenna doesn\'t know he took her.\n2. Mostly check. Sansa is solely dependent on him, and is mostly grateful that he killed Joffrey, but she doesn’t really trust him. She considers that he might be worse than the Lannisters.\n3. **Fail. Sansa is still married to Tyrion Lannister**, and will only become single if Tyrion is killed or sent to the Wall. Since Littlefinger had nothing to do with framing Tyrion for the murder, Sansa will remain married for the foreseeable future.\n4. Check. Everyone suspects Tyrion of the murder because of Cersei, and if not for her they would suspect Obaryn Martell. Everyone thinks Petyr is far away in the Vale.\n\nAnd let’s compare it to what he would get out of *Tyrion’s* death:\n\n1. Check. Nothing about Dontos and Sansa’s plan changes if Tyrion dies.\n2. Mostly check. Sansa is mostly grateful that Tyrion is dead and very grateful for being taken away from Joffrey. She is theoretically even more dependent on Petyr since she has no husband, but may be more suspicious of him since he killed her husband.\n3. **Check! Sansa is a widow immediately, no trials or frame job required.**\n4. Check. Petyr framed King Joffrey for the murder of Tyrion. He orchestrated the dwarf joust despite Joffrey’s objections because he knew Tyrion would hate it. He wanted to start a fight between uncle and nephew before the pie was served, causing Tyrion to die after repeatedly insulting/being insulted by the king. Anyone who did not suspect Joffrey would suspect the Tyrells, who also wanted Sansa widowed. Since Joffrey and Margaery are king and queen, and Tyrion was widely hated, there would probably be no investigation of the murder. “He choked on his pigeon pie.”\n\nIf Littlefinger framing Joffrey for murder sounds totally off-hand to you, I will remind you that he’s likely already done it twice. First was Bran’s attempted murder, which Petyr framed the Lannisters for, and which Jaime, Cersei, and Tyrion Lannister all conclude that Joffrey was responsible for. Next was Ser Merryn Trant’s attempted murder of Tyrion during the battle of the Blackwater, which Littlefinger almost certainly orchestrated but which Tyrion and Cersei conclude was Joffrey’s doing. Again, the convenient thing about framing Joffrey is that he is known for violence, and that nobody will directly question or accuse him.\n\nMost damning for the wine theory on Littlefinger\'s front: In Joffrey’s murder, he had no motive. Sansa and Littlefinger are both being honest here:\n\n&gt;“My lord, I... I do not understand... Joffrey gave you Harrenhal, made you Lord Paramount of the Trident... why...”  \n“Why should I wish him dead?” Littlefinger shrugged. **“I had no motive."**\n\nThen, in explaining why he would do something he had no motive to do, Littlefinger spouts some absolute bullshit. He had the time between when the bells began ringing a royal dirge to when Sansa arrived to come up with this crap:\n\n* “Always keep your foes confused. If they are never certain who you are or what you want, they cannot know what you are like to do next. Sometimes the best way to baffle them is to make moves that have no purpose, or even seem to work against you. Remember that, Sansa, when you come to play the game.”\n\n"Always keep your foes confused" is an obvious deflection for Littlefinger, which saves face compared to admitting that he got the wrong Lannister killed. It\'s also worth maintaining the lie that Joffrey was meant to die, since Sansa hated him. This passage also serves as absolutely GARBAGE advice. As she comes to play the game, Sansa will be extremely ineffective if she thinks the best political strategy is to be confusing and do things which don’t serve your interests. If Sansa takes this to heart, Littlefinger can be assured that she will never become an effective enemy to him. It definitely seems that Sansa in seasons 6-8 of Game of Thrones took this advise to heart.\n\n# Olenna\n\nThe Queen of Thorns clearly took the poison from Sansa\'s hair net, but why? \n\nWhy were the Tyrells in on this? It always seemed odd that, should either of these parties want Joffrey dead, they would invite the other to join the conspiracy. Surely the Tyrells and Petyr have sufficient resources to murder Joffrey on their own. If Tyrion is the target, however, it is both safer to reveal the conspiracy to a third party, and serves as a mutually beneficial way to improve Tyrell-Baelish relations.\n\nThe conspiracy would be thus: Petyr arranges for Sansa to smuggle poison into the feast, and for jousting dwarves to spark conflict between Joffrey and Tyrion. Olenna passes the poison on to a pre-arranged server, who puts it on Tyrion\'s food. Tyrion dies, and there is no investigation since everyone hates him and Joffrey is the primary suspect. Nobody suspects Sansa of murdering Tyrion. When Olenna leaves for Highgarden two days later, she takes Sansa with her to marry Willas. The Tyrells get Sansa and the North, and for Littlefinger, Tyrion\'s death is its own reward since he was taxing brothels, and since he knew that Littlefinger started the war.\n\nThe Tyrells do not know that Littlefinger wants Sansa, and certainly not for sentimental reasons. Petyr double-crosses Olenna, taking Sansa for himself. It is paramount that her identity remains a secret so that Olenna presumes that she ran away, and not that Littlefinger stole her, so as to preserve the now-tentative Baelish-Tyrell alliance.\n\nFinally on the Tyrells: Didn\'t they want Joffrey dead, because he was a danger to Margaery? Yes. And Littlefinger describes how they already had a different arrangement prepared:\n\n&gt;"Who better to protect his daughter than her splendid knightly brother? And it relieved him of the difficult task of trying to find lands and a bride for a third son, never easy, and doubly difficult in Ser Loras’s case. Be that as it may. Lady Olenna was not about to let Joff harm her precious darling granddaughter, but unlike her son she also realized that under all his flowers and finery, Ser Loras is as hot-tempered as Jaime Lannister. Toss Joffrey, Margaery, and Loras in a pot, and you’ve got the makings for kingslayer stew."\n\nLoras was an implicit threat to Joffrey against harming the queen, and he would give his life and his honor to defend his sister from the king. The Tyrells could have Joffrey killed at any time, and easily at a time less precarious for their ambitions than the very day of their own royal wedding, before the bedding which would have secured Margaery\'s queendom.\n\nThat about covers it. Sorry this is such a long post, but I wanted to address every angle. For those who scrolled to the bottom, here is a\n\nTL;DR:\n\nNobody besides Tyrion had the opportunity to poison the wine; since we know Tyrion is innocent, the wine must not have been poisoned. The poison was meant to look like choking on pie, and the only reason most characters think that the wine was poisoned is because Cersei accuses Tyrion of being the poisoner. Littlefinger had no motive to kill Joffrey, but he did have motive to kill Tyrion. Dontos said the pie is what killed him, and Joffrey’s last words were “the pie”. The Tyrells were in on killing Tyrion in order to obtain Sansa, and Littlefinger double-crossed Olenna by stealing Sansa.', 't2_4hazdtup', '(Spoilers Main) The Wine Story Does Not Add Up', 't3_14g4d3l', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/14g4d3l/spoilers_main_the_wine_story_does_not_add_up/')

In ‘47 the US Army Air Force only reported a crashed weather balloon. \n\nThese are interesting times with many agencies and contracting companies needing to quickly surface to explain the reasoning behind many secretive programs and/or cover-ups, including Roswell. \n\nI dare to say many would agree Roswell was indeed a cover up, and an official military institution of the United States has been lying to the people since 1947, and boldly since 1994. Here we are in 2023, and we may very well see Justice and a well deserved and conclusive truth to what many have been ridiculed for. To have a decisive revelation only to accept that our Government has openly lied to its people is disheartening, though we can only assume and hope it was for good measure and safety. \n\nThe documents reads:\n\nIn July 1994, the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force concluded an exhaustive search for records in response to a General Accounting Office (GAO) inquiry of an event popularly known as the "Roswell Incident." The focus of the GAO probe, initiated at the request of a member of Congress, was to determine if the U.S. Air Force, or any other U.S. government agency, possessed information on the alleged crash and recovery of an extraterrestrial vehicle and its alien occupants near Roswell, N.M. in July 1947.\n\nThe 1994 Air Force report concluded that the predecessor to the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Army Air Forces, recovered debris from an Army Air Forces balloon-borne research project code named MOGUL. Records located describing research carried out under the MOGUL project, most of which were never classified (and publicly available) were collected, provided to GAO, and published in one volume for ease of access for the general public.\n\nThis report discusses the results of this exhaustive research and identifies the likely sources of the claims of "alien bodies" at Roswell. Contrary to allegations, many of the accounts appear to be descriptions of unclassified and widely publicized Air Force scientific achievements. Other descriptions of "bodies" appear to be actual incidents in which Air Force members were killed or injured in the line of duty.', 't2_lx4fxvzh', '29 Years Ago Today: US Air Force closes case on Roswell, advising the people of the US that the “bodies” recovered were test dummies from Project Mogul.

It's one of the few jobs I've found that allows me to work at my own pace in the evenings while still being capable of performing all the tasks I need to complete by closing time.\n\nAbout three months ago, the father of one of our customers called management and asked that we refuse service to his daughter, who'd been a regular customer up until this point. Apparently she was an alcoholic who was supposed to have been in rehab, but had been purchasing liquor from us on the down-low -- and her father wanted us to help prevent that. My coworkers and I were shown her picture, asked to turn her away if she came in, and informed that she had already been verbally banned from the store, so she *shouldn't* be coming back.\n\nCut to a week and a half ago. The father left us a voice-mail informing us that his daughter had just successfully completed two months' rehab, that she was moving back in with him, that he'd like to thank us for our help, and that he'd like to ask us to continue being vigilant. We agreed.\n\nWell, about an hour ago she came to the store. I didn't recognize her -- wasn't even thinking about who was in front of me. I honestly didn't even look at her face. She picked up a dickey of vodka, paid me exact cash, smiled, and left. And I didn't even realize it was her until she was *leaving*.\n\nAs soon as I realized what I'd just done, I wrote a note to my manager apologizing and explaining what had happened.\n\nI feel so ashamed. Like I personally fucked up her sobriety. Like I've failed my job, her dad, *and* her.\n\nI'm going to get in so much trouble with my boss -- I already know it -- and I'm sure he'll have to say something to her father, as well, which also reflects badly on me and on my employer. I guess I just need someone to help me not break down in tears. My distractability definitely fucked me over here. And I can't help but feel like a little bit of a fuckup in response.\n\n**Edit**: First of all, thanks so much for commenting, everyone. I've been responding to specific questions, but I'm just trying to absorb everyone's support, observations, and well-wishes while I wait for work to begin tonight.\n\nI'll update once I talk with my manager tonight or tomorrow, depending on when it is we see each other next.\n\nOne common question I see is whether or not I ought to have asked for the customer's ID. To answer, I'm not required to ID customers unless they appear 19 or below, since I live in B.C., Canada. I have between when the customer opens the door and when they step up to the counter to decide whether or not a person looks 19 or older to me. She most certainly looked older than 19. And even if I had IDd her, for whatever reason, it likely would not have helped. I don't know her first name, and, as we all know, photo ID is not always representative of our day-to-day appearances.\n\n**Edit 2**: Another thing I've seen is whether or not it's illegal to deny this customer service because we've been asked to. I'm a little miffed that it took me this long, but I've finally looked up whether our actions go against the Human Rights Code of Canada, and they most certainly seem to. Substance use disorders, including alcoholism, are considered a disability under Canadian law, and it is illegal for us to refuse service on the basis of a customer's alcoholism. (I can, however, refuse service if someone is actually drunk while they are in the store, of course.) I'm not really sure what to *do* with this information, truth be told, but it's something for me to chew on, at least.", 't2_f9zpq', "I just sold liquor to a customer we're supposed to have banned from the store, and I feel absolutely awful about it", 't3_14d4pa9', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/14d4pa9/i_just_sold_liquor_to_a_customer_were_supposed_to/')

It would have been fine if the wedding party were also only allowed beer and wine.\n\nThe wedding party got ready at the venue, and they kept bottles of liquor in the rooms they got ready in. So every so often, the wedding party would disappear to go make their mixed drinks and take shots out of the view of the guests who were having to pay $8 for a tiny cup (think those little clear plastic cups that are half the size of a solo cup) of cheap beer and wine.\n\nAll the guests were basically sober due to how expensive the drinks were and because you had to wait in line for over 10 minutes just to get one drink while everyone in the wedding party was wasted an hour and a half in. So the reception pretty much ended up being the guests watching the wedding party dance and actually party because we didn’t have the liquid courage to join in. I just felt like allowing the wedding party to have liquor, but making the rest of the guests pay for only beer or wine was so tacky.

For those that haven\'t tried a KTV experience: you sit down with 2-4 friends, order drinks and food and just take turns singing. There are a lot of bar/restaurants and craft breweries in town, but not a whole lot of nighttime activities, so I see demand potential. The issue is that my home county is very weird about its liquor licenses and only restaurants and distilleries can apply to serve hard liquor.  I was hoping to start small and and keep scope contained by just serving alcohol (even if it means aiming to break even while I figure things out). \n\nMe: I have little experience in the bar/food industries, and I\'ve read quite a few "don\'t open a bar" reddit posts to hedge profitability expectations, so I\'m trying to be mindful of biting off more than I can chew. I\'m working with about $100k in savings and could probably borrow against that amount or wait until I\'ve had more saved up from my current job.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n* Based on your experience with restaurants/bars, is the additional margin on liquor worth even entertaining selling food? Do you think that might deter customers?\n* Should this be a deal-breaker that would make me consider starting the business in another county/going back to the drawing board altogether?\n* Would this be a reasonable reason to try to partner with a local food vendor to support that function?

He name dropped the GM and the sales manager, but said that he wanted to speak to me since I was the AGM and I was present.  He said that he wanted to "make me aware" of something in his room, namely, a half-empty bottle of whiskey he found in his room behind the sheets in the closet (for the sofa bed), which he said were also torn apart and disorganized.\n\nImmediately, I apologized and said that this was not our standard, and that I would follow-up with the housekeeper that cleaned the room and the manager how inspected it to see what happened.  He said "No, please, don\'t get anyone into trouble." I said it wasn\'t trouble, just making sure standards are met.\n\nSo I asked him his room number....818 (just an arbitrary number for this post).  I thought about it.  I had a flashback.  Moments of my life literally came back to me.  You see, the night prior, the night auditor had called out.  I got stuck with his shift.  11pm-6am.  Back at 2pm.  I crashed in the hotel instead of drive home and then drive back.  I stayed in....\n\n818\n\nI like to have "fun" in the room and check everything to make sure it works right when I sleep in a room.  Sofa bed linens straight, iron has no black gunk on it, stovetop in the room (we have stoptops in our suites) works, etc.  I even boiled water on the stove to make tea just to have something to do.  Everything was in perfect order.  I gave myself a late 2pm c/o, which means my room was one of the last the housekeeper cleaned.  Not only did I stay in the room the night before, I checked it with my housekeeping supervisor at 4pm, and punched its status in the phone at that time.  And I check EVERYTHING.

Something about some girls being served who were underage and they got pulled over right outside the restaurant or right down the road. Since then, the owner implemented policies about “no to go cups/bowls at a table that has liquor”. I learned about that recently when I had a lady pour an entire 22 ounce frozen margarita in her friends to go box. And another lady sneak out a drink in to go water after she dumped out the water in a glass. And another who tried to sneak one out, but I warned the manager beforehand. It happens a lot. \n\nWell, I had a two ladies last night who both ordered drinks, separate checks, along with a cheese dip appetizer.

I informed her of the policy and said “once those drinks are empty, I’ll be happy to bring the to go bowl for that queso” and went to check my other tables. It was a little hectic from multiple call outs so sections were way bigger than usual.\n\nI come back a little later and the lady jumps down my throat about how “you didn’t even offer to take it to box it yourself, you just have a speech about your ‘policy’ and that’s not okay! Next time, you should offer!”  So I said I’d take it and put it in the bowl for her right then and she let me take it. I immediately got my manager and told him what happened and he went ahead and poured the dip in a bowl and I asked if he could take it to her and explain the policy to her himself. Which he did and he was at the table for several minutes talking to them. \n\nWhen I checked on them again, I’d already dropped off the checks the previous times and they were now ready to pay. Lady on the left said “no change”. It was exact change for the bill. Lady in the right was apologetic, kind of, and paid card. 0 in the tip line and they left 1 dollar. Combined, their bill was about 60 bucks.\n\nWhen I spoke to another coworker about it, he even said since COVID, we aren’t supposed to take half eaten food to the back to box ourselves.

I do not have any documentation proving that I am a tribal member as I lost it years ago, but my dad does and he is located in San Diego.\n\nI have severe GERD and it does serious damage to my teeth. Brushing and flossing can only do so much to help when constant acid is rising from my esophagus. I don’t have insurance and it’s not easy for me to get care so I have kind of just been using daily tums and hoping for the best. However, a few months ago all my teeth started falling apart. At least 2 of them have chipped and I have multiple painful cavities all over my mouth (like more than 10) and my mouth hurts excruciatingly whenever I chew anything. Maybe I need root canals Idk. Not wanting to surrender to dentures, two months ago I called the Indian Health Clinic near my dad and they said they would accept my dad’s tribal membership as proof of my own and I scheduled the nearest appointment out, which was for this afternoon. The way it works is that if they do an initial examination and it shows emergency work is needed they can schedule me to come back in the following days and I won’t have to wait 2 months in between.\n\nSo I booked a non refundable hostel for a week and a plane flight for spirit airlines to get me there several hours before my appointment. This was the fuck up, but It was the cheapest option and the trip was going to take all of the money I could spare. If I had paid a little more with a different airline or to get there a day early this wouldn’t have happened.\n\nI got to the airport at 4 am, checked in, and sat at the gate. Right as everyone was preparing to board, the spirit employee behind the counter at the gate suddenly announced the flight was cancelled with no explanation. People were saying it was because the pilot didn’t show up but I have no idea if that’s true. After waiting in line to talk to the spirit employee, they have no flight they can rebook for me until tomorrow, well past my appointment. She told me she could give me a refund on my $120 ticket that I could shop around at other airline counters with, but those tickets were for $500. I decided to get it on credit, but the travel app wouldn’t sell it to me because I had “another similar trip leaving at around the same time” and when it finally let me confirm I wanted it anyway, it had “just sold out while I was booking”\n\nThe remaining tickets are now $1,200 and I can’t afford that. There is no way for me to get to my appointment and save my teeth. By the time I could do this again in several months it will definitely be too late.\n\nTLDR chose to fly spirit and now I lose all my teeth and continue living in agony.', 't2_5g39o', 'TIFU: by choosing Spirit Airlines', 't3_14jedr7', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/14jedr7/tifu_by_choosing_spirit_airlines/')

Im up to the final quest/boss, but I’m busy doing other stuff first, so if there’s anything in the end section that impacts on theses theories I won’t know about it yet. But SPOILERS for everything up to there.\n\n# Theory 1: The Identity of the Soldier Spirits in the Depths\n\nI’m sure you’ve encountered these shadowy apparitions atop of rocky pillars in the Depths, offering their pristine weapons, but have you ever wondered who they are? \n\nWere there battles within the Depths, perhaps during the Imprisoning War, and these are the spirits of these fallen soldiers? Some have pointed out that their designs are similar to the soldiers in OoT, so are they maybe from that time period?\n\nWhile there likely were battles within the Depths during the Imprisoning War, I don’t think these ghosts come from that time period or from OoT. Let me explain why.\n\nI was surprised the first time [I encountered this](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/728438394669236234/1122364206033940550/IMG_3534.png) within the Depth. It was a much larger rocky pillar with three soldier spirits facing each other. The location of this pillar in the Depths corresponded to [the edge of the Great Plateau](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/728438394669236234/1122364206424014948/IMG_3533.png) on the surface. At first I wasn’t sure of the significance of this, but I was positive that this meant a battle must have happened at this location some time in the past. \n\nThings started to become clearer when I encountered a [second of these larger pillars with three soldiers](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/728438394669236234/1122364207321591819/IMG_3550.png) just outside the [Ancient Underground Fortress](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/728438394669236234/1122364208240148490/IMG_3548.png). Its corresponding location on the surface are the [Akkala Citadel Ruins](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/728438394669236234/1122364207757807737/IMG_3549.png). This was the location of a very well known battle in the past. During the Calamity, 100 years before the beginning of BotW, the remnants of Hyrule’s army took a last stand against the swarming Guardians under the influence of Calamity Ganon’s Malice at the Akkala Citadel. [This is explained in further detail in Creating a Champion](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/728438394669236234/1122376736055767091/IMG_3621.png). \n\nIt occurred to me that if these larger gathering places of soldier spirits happened at one of the battlefields during the Calamity, then perhaps I would find more of them at other battlefields from that time as well. So, I next checked around the Depths below [Fort Hateno](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/728438394669236234/1122364208995127296/IMG_3546.png), the [second location of a last stand during the Calamity](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/728438394669236234/1122376736512933969/IMG_3622.png), and sure enough there was [another gathering of soldier spirits](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/728438394669236234/1122364208676352010/IMG_3547.png). \n\nIt now seemed very likely that these were the spirits of soldiers who had died during the Calamity, 100 years ago. However, I had forgotten one [important point about the Depths](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/728438394669236234/1122365041111478372/IMG_3285.png), they are a Dark World which mirrors Hyrule. Important locations on the surface are mirrored in some way in the Depths. *And vice versa*. I had forgotten to check exactly what was above these gatherings of soldier spirits on the surface.\n\nIt was thanks to this [Youtube Short](https://youtube.com/shorts/PdbZf3EvUXk) that I learned the answer: [monuments dedicated by Zelda to the memory of the souls lost to the Calamity](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/728438394669236234/1122364422992691220/IMG_3538.png). This explicitly connected the souls lost to the Calamity, 100 years ago, with the spirits of soldiers in the Depths. I had first encountered one of these monuments early in the game and had forgotten about them. It was in [the ruins of Castle Town](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/728438394669236234/1122364422522937354/IMG_3539.png), where Calamity Ganon’s attack first began. I went to check this location in the Depths, and found the [corresponding soldier spirits](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/728438394669236234/1122364422183202836/IMG_3540.png). \n\nThe second monument was above the first gathering of soldier spirits I had encountered, [outside the Great Plateau](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/728438394669236234/1122364424116776991/IMG_3537.png). Creating a Champion goes into detail about why this was a significant location during the Calamity, as seen [here](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/728438394669236234/1122376736869453864/IMG_3623.png) and [here](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/728438394669236234/1122376737381154837/IMG_3624.png). \n\nChecking the soldier spirit locations near the [Akkala Citadel](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/728438394669236234/1122364424863350804/IMG_3535.png) and [Fort Hateno](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/728438394669236234/1122364424481677322/IMG_3536.png), I found monuments dedicated by Zelda there too. I don’t know if these four locations are the only ones in the game. If you know of others please feel free to mention them in the comments. \n\nAll of these larger gatherings of soldier spirits in the Depths are surrounded by a number of single soldier spirits on rocky pillars. But they are also found all over the Depths. Is it a fact that every single one of these soldiers died during the Calamity, 100 years ago? I’m not sure, but it seems like a large number of them are connected to that event.\n\nAnother question connected with these spirits is: why are the weapons they offer pristine, and not corrupted by Ganondorf’s gloom? This is especially curious since the Depths are where the Gloom originates and is more concentrated. I think I have an answer, but I want to hold off until I do some more research.\n\nThe soldier spirits are not the only souls found within the Depths, which leads us to our next theory.\n\n# Theory 2: The Connection Between the Depths and Spirits \n\nI’ve already touched on the connections between the surface of Hyrule and the Depths below it. They are mirrors of each other. Most importantly, Hyrule is the Light World, and the Depths are the Dark World. The Depths are intrinsically linked to Darkness, and there’s a whole lot to say about that, but I’m leaving that to a later post. For now, there are plenty of other ways the two worlds mirror each other. \n\nThe geography for a start. For example, mountains on the surface are valleys in the Depths, and vice versa. This connection is physical. The Depths are literally located underneath the surface of Hyrule. [Hot springs are above lava flows below](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1116509777787375626/1117561721020743790/IMG_3283.png). The source of the Sacred Springs on the surface are the corresponding Wellsprings below them. That’s the definition of a wellspring.\n\nBut, whereas the surface of Hyrule is teeming with life, the [Depths below it are a wasteland](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1116509777787375626/1117561584236114041/IMG_3287.png). There is some unique life, like the Frox and Deep Fireflies, and [there is plant life](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1116509777787375626/1117561586266144838/IMG_3291.png), all of which will be explored more at a later date. But, it’s still a stark contrast to the surface above. If Hyrule is a world of life, it’s fair to say that the Depths are a world of the dead. Just like in classical mythology, it is a true Underworld of Hyrule. \n\nApart from the soldier spirits we discussed above, the Depths are littered with Poes, the lost souls of the dead: [1](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/728438394669236234/1122365135982448780/IMG_3596.png), [2](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/728438394669236234/1122365136246681711/IMG_3597.png), [3](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/728438394669236234/1122365136619978782/IMG_3598.png). \n\nIf the Bargainer Statues are to be believed (and that’s a big if! I will go into more detail about them at a later date), Poes are the souls of the good and bad who become lost on the way to the afterlife. If this is true, the Depths are not the final destination for the dead. It may just be one level of the Underworld, just as other classical Underworlds had multiple levels.\n\nAt this point, it will be interesting to see how the various races of Hyrule viewed the Depths. After all, during the height of Zonai civilisation, they assisted in the mining of Zonaite within the Depths.\n\nAs far as I can tell, we don’t really know what the Hylians thought of the Depths at that time. The same is true for the Rito and Zora. We see evidence that these two races mined the Depths along the Zonai, but not much else. Statues depicting each race act as [guideposts leading to the mines below their homes](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1116509777787375626/1117561584911384626/IMG_3288.png). \n\nThings become more interesting with the Gorons: [1](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/728438394669236234/1122364832981733458/IMG_3321.png), [2](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/728438394669236234/1122364833392758814/IMG_3322.png), [3](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/728438394669236234/1122364835296989194/IMG_3319.png), [4](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/728438394669236234/1122364835779321866/IMG_3320.png), [5](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/728438394669236234/1122364836223914054/IMG_3620.png). \n\nThe strange vehicles and advanced technology Dugby wonders about is Zonai technology. Out of all the races, the Gorons are the only ones who decided to live down in the Depths at that time. And it makes total sense. Gorons love mining. The Zonai and their ally races went down into the Depths to mine Zonaite, and so the Gorons moved down there and built themselves a city. Gorondia. To the Gorons, the Depths were just a place to mine.\n\nWhat about the Gerudo? As usual, they are the most interesting. The Gerudo at one time were the allies of the Zonai. We see a line of their statues go all the way from the Great Abandoned Central Mine, below the Great Plateau and where the Zonai temple is located, all the way to the Abandoned Gerudo Mine below Gerudo Town. Remember that the Zonai have lived on the surface long before the time of Rauru and Mineru, the last of the Zonai. Long before Ganondorf became king of the Gerudo. Therefore, it makes sense that in the distant past, the Zonai and Gerudo once worked together in the mining of Zonaite.\n\nBut, how did the Gerudo view the Depths? Unlike the other races, the Gerudo seemed to understand the true nature of the Depths: [1](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/728438394669236234/1122365041853866024/IMG_3295.png), [2](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/728438394669236234/1122365042428477541/IMG_3296.png), [3](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/728438394669236234/1122365042814365696/IMG_3297.png). \n\nThe Gerudo understood that the Depths were the Underworld, a place of the dead. Unlike the Rito and Zora - who only built mines, unlike the Gorons – who built a city to live in, the Gerudo built a burial ground. The [Gerudo Underground Cemetery](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/728438394669236234/1122364653457125426/IMG_3607.png). A place [swarming with the wrath of the executed](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/728438394669236234/1122364653901725746/IMG_3608.png). A [resting place for lost souls](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/728438394669236234/1122364654300168274/IMG_3609.png). This shouldn’t surprise us. In both OoT and TP, the Gerudo built structures connected with the dead and the afterlife. Out of all of the races, they seem to have the greatest knowledge on the subject, and would recognise the nature of the Depths.\n\nAnother connection between the Depths and spirits is [highlighted in this video](https://youtu.be/rFxyMCGl__s). Lover’s Pond is a heart shaped pond located on Tuft Mountain, near Lurelin Village. Legend says that you can meet your soulmate at the pond, and many Hyruleans have made the journey hoping to find true love. Directly below Lover’s Pond, in the Depths, is the Ancient Observation Deck. Here on a [heart shaped island in the middle of a lake can be found two Poes](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/728438394669236234/1122365040180330586/IMG_3543.png). Are these two soulmates still bound together after death? Perhaps the sight of this moved the Zonai to build the observation deck. There are also many other Poes surrounding the area. Perhaps reflecting the many people who have journeyed to Lover’s Pond over the ages?\n\nThis concentration of Poes leads us to the final point of this theory. Large numbers of Poes, the lost souls of the dead, can be found especially around the large mines below each of the settlements thriving on the surface. This makes sense. Towns and villages have a large population of people in one area, therefore a larger number of those who die at these locations become lost souls within the Depths. After all, the surface of Hyrule and the Depths below it are a mirror reflecting each other.\n\nAs was just mentioned, these large concentrations of Poes are located in large mines where an abundance of Zonaite was mined in the past, and that fact leads us to the final theory of this post.\n\n# Theory 3: Zonaite Contains Spirit/Soul Energy \n\nI’ve been leading to this theory as a major conclusion in this series of posts, and a number of you in the comments of the last post already guessed where this was heading. I’m glad others are thinking along the same lines!\n\nAs a brief recap of [that last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/14c8znn/totk_two_more_small_theories/), Zonaite can be found from two sources: by processing Luminous Stones, and in the Depths. Dondons only eat Luminous Stones, and their waste product is precious gems and ores, including Zonaite. We also concluded that the Zonai mined Luminous Stones in the Sky Mines, which they processed into Zonaite, mimicking the natural process of the Dondons, long before they went into the Depths and mined the vast quantities of Zonaite ore found there. Zonaite was the foundation of their civilisation and technology.\n\nIn BotW, the item description for Luminous Stones said that some believed they glow with a pale blue light in the dark, because they contain the souls of the dead. [TotK has that same item description](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/728438394669236234/1122365284485967933/IMG_3559.png). If this is true, then we could easily conclude that Zonaite, which can be processed from Luminous Stones, also contains the souls of the dead.\n\nBut there’s a catch. Remember the Dondons? They don’t create only Zonaite from Luminous Stones. [They create a whole lot of precious gems too](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/728438394669236234/1119792040830574602/IMG_3327.png). Diamonds, rubies, sapphires, topaz, and opals. That means that Luminous Stones contain  more than the elements that make up Zonaite.\n\nPrecious gems contain the power of the Elements. Not the elements in the periodic table. The elemental forces and magics that power the world. [Diamonds](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/728438394669236234/1122365405860732998/IMG_3560.png) are said to harness the power of Light. [Rubies](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/728438394669236234/1122365281822584912/IMG_3554.png) contain the power of Fire. [Sapphires](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/728438394669236234/1122365282271367189/IMG_3555.png) contain the essence of Ice. [Topaz](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/728438394669236234/1122365283131211816/IMG_3556.png) contain the power of Electricity. And, [Opals](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/728438394669236234/1122365283529658368/IMG_3557.png) contain the power of Water.\n\nIf all of these gems, and the powers they contain, can be processed from Luminous Stones, then the power contained within Luminous Stones themselves is astonishing. It’s the very power of creation itself.\n\nThe importance of the Elements is also highlighted by their association with the Sages. There are the Sages of Wind, Fire, Water, and Electricity. Three of those have a precious gem associated with that Element. There is no precious gem with the power of Wind, but the Secret Stone of Wind is green, which means that a gem like emerald might be connected with that Element. There are also the Sages of Time and Light. Time is associated with a golden colour, but it’s not clear if there is a corresponding gem. Rauru’s secret stone of Light is white in colour, which could correspond to Diamond.\n\nThat leaves one Sage. One Element. Mineru is the Sage of Spirit. [Her secret stone is a purplish blue in colour](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/728438394669236234/1122365519266332672/IMG_3593.png). That doesn’t exactly match to the bluish green of Zonaite, though it is close. Does Zonaite contain the power of Spirit?\n\nWell, we’ve already established that the Zonai mined most of their Zonaite from the Depths. We’ve established that the Depths are connected with the spirits of the dead. We’ve established that large concentrations of Poes, lost souls of the dead, are found in the same locations where there were vast deposits of Zonaite ore. Is all of this a coincidence?\n\nThink too, where was the Spirit Temple? In the Depths. This is where the Sage of Spirit worked: [1](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/728438394669236234/1122365516242227200/IMG_3309.png), [2](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/728438394669236234/1122365516741353513/IMG_3308.png). \n\nMineru, the Sage of Spirit, was researching materials collected from the Depths, where there is an abundance of spirits. She wanted to unlock the hidden potential of Zonai Charges, the [energy within Zonaite](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/728438394669236234/1122365656868868186/IMG_3411.png). And what was Mineru’s main goal? \n\nOne of the Ancient Stone Tablets tells us:\n\n&gt;Queynte Mineru, the kynges elder suster, falles so dep in hir bokes swich that she oft foryetes to eten. In min wieried wei don y what much y con, but y fer haven that it ben litel avail. Of late treteth she of \'constructes,\' thinges did she make with her hondes as vessel for spirit whan bodi-lich failen. So, seyde she, might she liven longe, in spiret yhused within this \'construct.\' Though Mineru ne semes to holden ani deceyte… Bi my feith, y kan nat als trouthe thes wordes bileven\n\nThis can be translated as:\n\n&gt;Quaint Mineru, the king\'s elder sister, falls so deep in her books such that she oft forgets to eat. In my worried way do I what much I can, but I fear have that it be little avail. Of late treats she of \'constructs,\' things did she make with her hands as vessel for spirit when body lies fallen. So, said she, might she live long, in spirit housed within this \'construct.\' Though Mineru nay seems to hold any deceit… By my faith, I can not also truth these words believe.\n\nShe was researching Constructs being used as vessels for the spirits of the fallen. This means that [Constructs would have to be compatible with the spirit of a dead person](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/728438394669236234/1122365517043351652/IMG_3584.png). Well, Constructs are powered by the energy from Zonaite, just like all of Zonai technology. If that energy is spirit energy, the energy from souls, it would make sense that the technology would be compatible with a dead person’s spirit.\n\nWe call it Zonai technology, but it’s really magic. In an [interview with the developers](https://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-9-the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-part-4/) we learn:\n\n&gt; Dohta: In terms of features, one of the things we ended up not including in the last game was “magic.” Previously, we had a Stamina Wheel for physical actions, but there was nothing equivalent to a “magic gauge.” This time, however, we wanted to incorporate that feature, so we added another unique ability: the magical Zonai Devices. As you can see in Aonuma-san’s gameplay demonstration video, you can generate wind or move objects with a Zonai Device. Using this power, for example, you can even create something absurd, such as an “omni-directional flamethrower.” There are many moments where you can cheat in a good way.\n\n&gt; Aonuma: Well, you say magic gauge – its visual is actually a battery. (Laughs)\n\n&gt; Takizawa: The initial concept of this game was to use the "supernatural power" of an unknown civilization, as opposed to the Sheikah civilization\'s “super ancient technology” in the previous game, so we decided to create lots of handy items with magical properties. However, even if we describe these items as “supernatural,” players won\'t use them unless they know what they are. So, this thing we were calling “magic” ultimately became...ahem, an electric fan.\n\n&gt; Takizawa: Since we felt it was important for our players to get what those items are at a glance, our designers ended up creating various home appliances. (Laughs) Coming up with ways to present them as something supernatural in the world of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild was quite a challenge. It was a great opportunity for us designers to put our skills to the test. (Laughs)\n\nThe developers wanted a contrast between the technology based Sheikah and the supernatural/magic based Zonai. The funny thing is that while Sheikah tech looks like magic, it\'s supposed to be super advanced technology that runs on the natural forces. Whereas [Zonai Devices look like technology]( https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/728438394669236234/1122365653492445184/IMG_3410.png), so the player understands what they do (a fan, the magic guage is a battery, etc.), but it\'s actually supernatural (water can just materialise from nowhere, etc.).\n\nThat means the energy from Zonaite is not an Element like Fire or Water. [Something found in nature](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/728438394669236234/1122365410214416454/IMG_3304.png). It’s supernatural. And, that perfectly fits Spirit energy. It comes from the souls of the dead.\n\nMining the dead has interesting implications. It’s reminiscent of Shinra mining Mako energy from the planet’s Lifestream in Final Fantasy VII, and [it doesn’t paint the Zonai in the best light](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/728438394669236234/1122365653853159445/IMG_3409.png). Perhaps there’s a good reason why so many monsters plagued Hyrule from the Depths, before Rauru created the Shrines of Light. It also may point to the forces propelling Ganondorf forward as the Sage of Darkness, the other Element of the Depths, and his hatred of the Zonai. But those are things for another post.\n\nIt also has interesting implications for the Constructs: [1](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/728438394669236234/1122365656273272893/IMG_3413.png), [2](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/728438394669236234/1122365654239039601/IMG_3414.png), [3](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/728438394669236234/1122365655124033617/IMG_3416.png). \n\nWhen Rauru says “we originally created” the Constructs, I don’t think he means Mineru and himself, but the Zonai in general, and they did this long before the time of Rauru. It’s interesting that the Constructs had different specialties, and that they eventually surpassed the Zonai in skill and knowledge. This is now sliding more towards speculation, but if the Constructs are powered from Spirit energy, from the souls of the dead, is it possible that something of those souls seeped into the Constructs? Could their variety, skill, and knowledge partly derive from the lives of the people who used to be alive? Is this what happened to the Zonai civilisation, why it was reduced to just Mineru and Rauru? Were their dead turned into energy instead of replenishing future generations? I know this is very speculative, but it’s food for thought. \n\nThis was a longer post than the last two.

For those that haven\'t tried a KTV experience: you sit down with 2-4 friends, order drinks and food and just take turns singing. There are a lot of bar/restaurants and craft breweries in town, but not a whole lot of nighttime activities, so I see demand potential. The issue is that my home county is very weird about its liquor licenses and only restaurants and distilleries can apply to serve hard liquor.  I was hoping to start small and and keep scope contained by just serving alcohol (even if it means aiming to break even while I figure things out). \n\nMe: I have little experience in the bar/food industries, and I\'ve read quite a few "don\'t open a bar" reddit posts to hedge profitability expectations, so I\'m trying to be mindful of biting off more than I can chew. I\'m working with about $100k in savings and could probably borrow against that amount or wait until I\'ve had more saved up from my current job.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n* Based on your experience with restaurants/bars, is the additional margin on liquor worth even entertaining selling food? Do you think that might deter customers?\n* Should this be a deal-breaker that would make me consider starting the business in another county/going back to the drawing board altogether?\n* Would this be a reasonable reason to try to partner with a local food vendor to support that function? I would like to avoid an equity partnership if I can.\n\nThanks!', 't2_gvqk8ocp', "I'm in the planning stages for a small entertainment bar.

We have a network of social media platforms that gives us total access to nearly everyone in the world and are supposed to connect us all, but we're all more separated from people in the real world than ever.\n\nAnd though we may turn to spirituality to find the truth, to try find something deeper and more meaningful in a shallow and surface-oriented world, it is more than apparent that most of us have lost our drive and spirit.\n\nAnd at the ironic height of all of our human achievements will be the creation of true and self-aware artificial intelligence that will eventually give life to autonomous androids, which in turn will more than likely render us all obsolete and irrelevant in every imaginable way.  To deny this is to deny what has obviously been seen time and time again in all of evolution.  So what is left for us in this world, and where is there left for us to turn as true seekers?\n\nAs always, the return to the heart of the matter is the journey towards one's very own mind.  *You simply have to save yourself, because no one else is coming to save you.*  In an age where hardly anyone even knows their true selves due to their prior programming and conditioning, you simply *must* break through and come to know yourself through mind; if not you will waste your entire life away without truly living or even making one single real real decision for yourself.  Most people will be enslaved for their entire lives without realizing it by others who *do* know themselves and what they want out of life; remember, not everyone who is awakened is good.\n\nIt is nearly impossible to see if you haven't escaped the matrix, but in Western society there is a vast and growing sickness of the mind that is unrepentantly and disturbingly contagious.  It is hard to name simply, but it is no different than a computer virus.  It is not quiet and illuminating wisdom, it is proud and unknowing ignorance.  It is not in unity or oneness, it is in narcissism and separation.  It is not in the direction of excellence, but in celebrating and revering mediocrity as if it was excellence.  Remember, *everyone is the hero of their own journey*, even the villains. The virus exists and is allowed to continually replicate because of the deeper failures of human nature: the mediocre minds cannot do the real inner work or face the great illumination of introspection, they never could, so they look outwardly to extend their afflictions universally instead.  They would change the entire world before they would change themselves, yourself included.\n\nIf one is not living in truth, then they are living in delusion.  If one is living in delusion, then they will unknowingly spread their delusions universally as if their delusions were the very truth itself.  Save your own mind, and don't accept the path of least resistance that they offer, and never let anyone else infect you with their delusions even if what they offer seems comfortable or familiar.  Remember, true greatness lies in being uncomfortable and in venturing into unknown territory, particularly if it is within.", 't2_vmjigaik', 'Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds.

That said, I have never experienced a worse airline anywhere in the world and I strongly recommend that you pay whatever the cost to travel by any other airline but Spirit. I chose them to travel to Virginia from Texas because the flight times were convenient and my outgoing flights worked just as planned. My return flight experience was a total nightmare. The hub for Spirit is Ft. Lauderdale Fl. When I checked my luggage in Richmond, my bag was one pound over the 40 lb. limit and the Spirit representative told me i would have to remove and carry items to reduce the weight or pay for a second bag. That was only the beginning but it was the least of my problems. \n\nWe flew to Ft. Lauderdale for my connecting flight to Austin, and right up to departure time the monitor at the gate said the flight was on time. At the time the flight was supposed to be boarding I asked the representative at the gate if I had missed an announcement of a delay and without even looking at me, she said the flight was cancelled. There was nothing on the monitor to indicate the flight was not leaving. She was rude and unhelpful when I asked if there were later flights. I found a customer service desk for Spirit and the two women reps were chatting and ignored me for several minutes. When one of them finally checked on flights to Austin, she said my best option was to fly to Baltimore and connect to Austin there, getting me home at midnight instead of 6 pm. So I waited for 5 hours to fly to Baltimore and when I got there I found that the flight to Austin was not the same day. I had to spend the night. In Baltimore . I asked a Spirit rep if they could recommend a hotel and she was rude and said I should have arranged that in Ft. Lauderdale even though I had no idea I was spending the dight in Baltimore. By this time it was midnight since the plane was late leaving Ft. Lauderdale. A woman in baggage claim helped me identify a hotel and I spent $20 on a cab and $140 on a hotel. The next morning I flew to Austin and of course my luggage was lost. In the true spirit of Spirit the representative I tried to get to file a claim acted rude, as if I had lost my own luggage. So by the time I got home, without my luggage I had been traveling for 26 hours for a flight that was supposed to take 5 hours with a layover. The Spirit employees main goal is to get you out of their face. I thought it was due to poor training, but I soon realized that they already know the system doesn't work to help their passengers so they don't even try. They just cop an attitude and tell you you're out of luck. And if you call on the phone, the call center is somewhere where no one speaks English. Not a coincidence. It is part of the plan built into the Spirit system. \n\nThis trip was the most expensive I have ever incurred flying to Richmond where my daughter lives. In the end for the cost of the tickets, the baggage fees, the seat fees and the hotel and cab fare, I spent more than $800. I could have flown 1st class on any other carrier for less. The stress and exhaustion of traveling for 26 hours and being treated horribly by every Spirit employee is something I can't describe other than as my worst nightmare. The Department of Transportation needs to do something to end the abusive practices of Spirit Airlines. They claim to be an economical airline but in fact they are a bait and switch business. Avoid them at all costs.", 't2_85udda9my', 'Flying Spirit Airlines possibly the biggest most expensive mistake you can make', 't3_13ukz6n', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/13ukz6n/flying_spirit_airlines_possibly_the_biggest_most/')

By this I don’t mean ghosts/pretas but descriptions of evil spirits or nature spirits like rakshasas, nagas, beings described as “ogres,” etc. It appears to me that these beings are not normally visible to us and probably dwell in another realm, but they also don’t seem to fit easily into any of the six lokas. Even more confusingly, I’ve read one source that classifies naga as animals, despite the fact that most people don’t seem to be able to perceive them and they appear to be intelligent beings with supernatural power. Is there any conceptualization of where such spirit beings “fit” in Buddhist cosmology or within the six lokas?

A cocktail that has been carefully crafted deserves to be enjoyed in the right glassware, which not only highlights its aesthetic appeal but also enhances the flavors in it. A set of cocktail glasses comes into play here. It is a collection of various kinds of glasses intended to enhance your mixology experience and go well with particular cocktails.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Set of cocktail glasses**: Investing in a high-quality[ cocktail glass set](https://smokeycocktail.com/collections/cocktail-glasses) is a game-changer if you\'re a cocktail enthusiast looking to take your mixology skills to the next level. It will also help you unleash your inner bartender. The right set of cocktail glasses not only gives your drinks a more refined appearance, but they also improve the taste and experience of your favorite drinks\n\n**Different Kinds of Cocktail Glasses**: Martini Glasses The long stems and inverted cone-shaped bowls of Martini glasses make them iconic. They are ideal for serving classic martinis and other sophisticated cocktails that are shaken or stirred. The wide open bowl lets the aroma gently waft while the long stem keeps the drink from being warmed by hand heat.\n\n**Highball Glasses**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe tall and slender highball glasses, also referred to as Collins glasses, are made for ice-filled drinks like mojitos, highballs, and gin and tonics.

Serving margaritas, daiquiris, and other frozen or shaken cocktails is made easy with these glasses. The drink\'s flavor and appearance are enhanced by the addition of salt or sugar to the wide rim.\n\nOld-fashioned glasses, also known as rocks glasses, are short, sturdy tumblers that are used to serve spirits "neat" (without ice) or on the rocks. They allow you to appreciate the color and aroma of the drink while you sip whiskey, bourbon, and other strong spirits.\n\nShot glasses are cylindrical, small glasses that are typically used to serve shots of distilled spirits or other small cocktails. They are ideal for quickly consuming drinks that are concentrated or for precisely measuring ingredients for mixology purposes.\n\nChampagne flutes are tall, slender glasses with a narrow, tapered bowl and a tall stem. They are made to be used with champagne and sparkling wines. You will be able to fully appreciate the beverage\'s effervescence and flavors thanks to the elongated shape, which helps preserve the bubbles and concentrate the aromas.\n\nWine glasses aren\'t usually used in cocktails, but they can be a part of a set of versatile cocktail glasses. They are absolutely necessary for drinks like sangrias and wine-based spritzers, which contain wine as an ingredient. The type of wine being served determines the shape and size of wine glasses.\n\nSpecialty Glasses In addition to the aforementioned classic[ cocktail glass](https://smokeycocktail.com/collections/cocktail-glasses), numerous specialty glasses are available for specific cocktails. These include copper mugs for Moscow mule drinks, tiki mugs for tropical cocktails, and absinthe glasses for the traditional absinthe ritual.

It gives your home bar or cocktail parties an air of sophistication and professionalism.\n\nImproves Drink Temperature Different cocktails necessitate particular temperature conditions for optimal flavor.

But by the end of the night, they are chasing girls, pretending they aren’t married (or getting married), buying girls drinks, letting girls sit on their laps all night, grinding with other women, going to the bathroom with other women, and honestly just seeing the bachelor party as their chance to be creeps all night. \n\nMost bachelors end up trying to take anything home with them including the bartenders (which is really just comedic to us- but gross if you think about it). \n\nPersonally if I was a women marrying these men, I’d change my mind just by the behavior I see at the BAR. This is before they even go to the strip club (if they make it there first, I’ve seen bachelors and their party go home with other women from our bar instead). \n\nNow I have a terrible idea of bachelor parties and I’m never going to be 100% cool with them. I know “some guys aren’t like that”, but as I’ve said, I’ve seen 5-10 a week and even the “better behaved” bachelor parties are doing very questionable things. \n\nMy question is, why is this event seen as a “hall-pass”?

I was so taken aback by the sheer outrageousness of what she’d said I just sort of laughed weakly and started serving the next customer.\n\nSince then, however, I’ve realised that her remark was totally out of order.

Will my account be taken as seriously as it would be had the genders been reversed?\n\nSo yeah, if you’re a male bartender that’s been subject to harassment at work, you’re not alone mate - stay strong!\n\nEDIT: didn’t think I’d need to clarify, but I’m not saying her asking for my number was harassment.

He got up and sat next to my daytime bartender who just got off, and she got up and left so he goes outside on the patio to sit by himself (it was a quiet, rainy night).\n\nThe regular tells me when she pulled up he was throwing up in the parking lot. On top of him being annoying, that was enough for me to be like, aiight good this dude is cut off, perfect.\n\nSo I go outside to cut him off, but I broke my toe two weeks ago and I\'m literally the only employee at the bar and there\'s only one other person now. This dude is fucked up, so I\'m a little nicer than I usually am in this situation despite the fact he\'s got his head basically passed out on the table when I walked out there. I\'m trying not to escalate shit.\n\nI tell him I\'ll pay for his beer, but that he\'s a liability at this point and I need him to leave. But he insists on paying it himself. So I get tired of arguing and agree to let him so he gets up off his seat.\n\n**And tucked in the front of his elastic waistband pants, the dude who was throwing up, creeping everyone out, and can barely talk at this point?

I\'m again, by myself and really not trying to start shit with this dude at this point (I do not carry.) so he comes into pay his tab with his phone.\n\nI see him opening apps and doing all sorts of finger movements so I\'m assuming he\'s got Apple Pay, but he\'s taking too long and starting to get comfortable sitting at the bar again. So I walk up and ask if he\'s paying or not, and his phone is completely dead. \n\nIt\'s been a black screen the whole time. He\'s just been like, touching ghost apps in his head.\n\nI tell him we\'re done. I\'m buying his tab (my boss will be eating the $5.50 on that one) and I need him to leave NOW. He goes to his car and spends a liiiiittttle too long in their with the engine running before he finally drives away.\n\nBartending. Fun times.\n\nEDIT: He only had **half of a beer** at my bar, and then I force fed him water for almost 30 minutes before asking him to leave and seeing the gun. I offered to call him an Uber/cab and he refused and said he was driving his car. I\'m not fucking arguing with the drunk guy with a gun.

They dump the ice from the tins they recently used &amp; just leave them on the station with the strainer on top so you couldn’t even pour into it if it was clean or you were making a repeat of the same cocktail.

They booked anyway a nice restaurant for a dinner with something like 100 guests, and a party with a DJ later in the evening. And for the context: B can sometimes be cheap, and SIL on the other side does not really look at price tags when she likes something. Opposites attract...\n\nThe wedding ceremony was fine, the dinner was great, and all guests were now enjoying themselves on the dance floor. I felt thirsty and went to the bar, and asked for a beer.\n\n"There you go Sir. That will be 3 euro.\n\n\\-I guess there is a misunderstanding, I am here for the wedding.\n\n\\-Yes Sir, I am sorry, but all drinks were free until dessert, but not during the dance party."\n\nSo I paid , and while I was sipping my beer, I could not help thinking "I know B can sometimes be cheap... but c\'mon, it\'s my brother\'s wedding, and I have to pay for a damn beer !"... B then came to me for a chat with a big smile, I decided to not bring it up and we just exchanged a couple of jokes.\n\nAnd right at that moment, SIL comes to the bar, holding two friends by the hand and shouts at the bartender "HEY, THESE TWO LADIES ARE MY BEST FRIENDS, SO GET THEM ANYTHING THEY WANT, ALL NIGHT LONG - COCKTAILS, SPIRITS, CHAMPAGNE, WHATEVER, OK ? PUT IT ON OUR TAB. WOOHOOO!"\n\nB hears that and stops his now wife and tells the bartender to hold on - the poor guy was confused. And B and SIL starts arguing in front of everyone on what kind of drinks they accepted to pay for (rem: in our country, it is very common that wedding guests get beer, wine and soft drinks for free, but if they want something extra like a cocktail, they will pay for it themselves, and that is ok). Guests were starting to wonder what is going on... and B then says to SIL "why would YOUR friends get an open bar and not mine ? Look, my brother is standing there with a beer, I am sure he would like a mojito or a cuba libre too, so why wouldn\'t I also tell my brother he gets all drinks for free ? Right, OP, you ordered a beer because you expected such drinks were free but you could do with something stronger, right ? RIGHT ?"\n\n...and I answered "hey, B, you know... actually.... I had to pay for this beer..."\n\nB and SIL then stopped quarreling and looked at each other with a pikachu face... and demanded to talk to the manager, and this time they were finally united in their anger. It turned out that the two bartenders were extras and had misunderstood what was covered or not... and I was not the only guest they had asked to pay for their drinks... They tried to talk to anyone who had to pay , apologized, offered to pay them back, etc.\n\nEpilogue: they are still married, still happy, 2 adorable kids, a house, and a cat.', 't2_tq364fv6', 'Bride and groom start a fight over who gets open bar... but the bartenders had got it all wrong...', 't3_148b50f', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingshaming/comments/148b50f/bride_and_groom_start_a_fight_over_who_gets_open/')

I'm friend's with the owners. We've had our ups and downs that escaladed but we've always worked through it. I have 1 shift every other Saturday. Tonight was slow for a Saturday so when my barback asked if he could sleep in later I told him no big deal he could take the night if he wanted to. Fast forward an hour, the bar had about 20 people and nothing insane. Once I covered my customers I went out for a cigarette. Of course some kid walks in right as I light the damn thing and so I figure he can wait 4 drags. In that time the owner sees a customer not being helped, loses her shit about where's the fucking bartender. I come in as she handed the kid his drink and she goes off on me that this place better be spotless when I close. She expects I sweep, mop, vacuum (yes, this bar is carpeted) and everything to be perfect because I cut my barback (again, no I didn't). She proceeds to pull another employee into the office to bitch about me while the other owner screamed at me behind the bar, physically blocking me in so I cannot get out and screaming at me to just do my fucking job. I took a deep breath. Spoke with some regulars who witnessed all of it and they encouraged me to leave. The problem is this bar has been my home bar forever. It's more than just leaving a job. So I continued to serve customers and do some dishes. Stocked the bar mostly, grabbed my tips. When boss no1 sat down and gave me the most childish gaslighting apology and I explained that it wasn't her comment that has set be off, it was partner #2. After telling her what he said she called me a liar and he chimed in also screaming at me (still on the floor mind you) that I'm lying. I said fine. I grabbed my things, said thank you for my employment and I left. I'm upset I lost my shit, I pride myself on my composure. I'm upset one of my favorite jobs I've ever had ended like this. But for the first time I respect myself too much to be spoken to like that.\n\n**Edit: about cutting the barback: after I told him he could take the night off he told me he'd come in later but just wanted to take a nap.

This means he only got $35 of the credit card tips, which, if you include the $15 he got in cash, means he walked away with about $50 for working 3 hours and only cleaning bottles. \n\nHe is very mad, and this is not the first time I had trouble with Alan, as he has complained to co-workers and myself about working with me. I know for a fact that there is a group chat with my co-workers that I’m not in where he bashes me regularly. Before he got promoted to being a bartender, we were pretty good friends and hung out often. He’s been bartending for about a month and a half and this is his first time bartending. I’ve been bartending for 6 months. Am I in the wrong in this situation? I feel as though I tipped him out properly. If he had stayed through volume he definitely would have received half of the credit card tips and a good deal more in cash tips. But he was gone, and it wasn’t my fault that he left. The manager cut him. Did I break a taboo?

I told my boss and he said next time tell her she chose to sit in other people’s filth, how are we to know? Then she ordered a mojito from the new server who asked me if we had them. I said no, we don’t have mint. We are a pub, we sell a lot of beer and mixed drinks but no mint. She (Karen who sat at a dirty table) wasn’t happy. I told my bosses if we get a bad google review, it’s me. 😁\n\nBiggest pet peeve as a bartender? Servers who spread their dirty glasses all over the grate at the station instead of stacking them and lining them up so the bartender has room to put their drinks that they need for the tables, especially those of us who are short and can’t reach over their mess. Every time they do it when I’m serving with them I move everything over and stack them hoping they get the hint. They don’t. Tomorrow we have a huge race coming through and we will be busy.

They get a huge amount of applications and I just couldn’t get my foot in the door. But I did some research and found out a bartending school worked closely with them. I did a tour of the school and found out that if a graduate of the school applies to any part of the casino, they get moved to the top of the list. Not as a barback but as a bartender. Is that the smartest thing the casino could do? Idk but I risked it. The school cost around $500 for two weeks. The bartenders at the casino on a good night make more than that. So starting out on slow shifts and conservatively thinking, it would take me less than a week to pay for the school. And that’s with no actual bartending experience prior to the job.

Though I'm a writer, I normally write only about music. This story took place just before the pandemic though the names and specific locations have been changed to protect anonymity. Pieced together from my journal, I decided it might be worth posting because this particular night set into motion a total transformation of how I saw myself and my sexuality. Maybe others can relate. Also it was pretty fucking hot.* \n\n*I was 31-years-old when this happened. Though I considered myself practically geriatric by gay standards back then, I can say looking back that I had a lot going for me. Six pack abs, thick biceps, and a similarly thick nicely above average cock. But I had just been dumped by my longtime boyfriend Noah so those attributes didn’t hold much value. My confidence was shot and I was lost...that is, until my best friend came to my rescue. Enjoy!*  \n\n\nWhen Mia offered to take me out for post-breakup drinks, neither of us expected the evening would end as it did...with her watching me face-fuck a guy. But if I’ve learned anything from that night, it’s that the line between assumptions and rationalizations are closer than we think.  \nShe'd had been my closest friend in LA for five years (which equals ten years of friendship in non-LA time). You could call me her gay best friend, but it’s always felt sort of reverse. Yes, technically, she’s straight, but Mia’s inner-soul is very much that of a gay man--take away her 34Ds, add a cock, and she’d be running Weho in no time.  As for me, Boystown has never exactly felt like my town. Perhaps it’s the fact that I’m not from here (I moved to LA from London eight years ago) but the truth is, I’m more comfortable watching a football match in a pub than dancing to a Rihanna-remix on Santa Monica Boulevard.    \nI originally met Mia professionally. I’m a music critic who took a liking to her just before her career blew up. She tells me my article about attending her stage show changed her life, but I can’t take the credit. I just reported the obvious. Yes, she has the looks but her talent and stage presence would stop anyone in their tracks. Our shared love for music developed into one of those friendships where both of us knew we could always rely on the other. Even though she’s now married and her music career’s skyrocketed, Mia always manages to find the time. On this night, she suggested we go to Esprit, a bar neither one of us knew--a spot where she was certain I wouldn’t have any nostalgia with Noah.   \nI met her outside--she was impeccably dressed as always and wore sunglasses despite it being dusk (an attempt to not be recognized). However, her long blonde hair sleekly pulled back and the black dress clinging to her curves made her anything but inconspicuous. Indeed, as soon as we walked in, I felt the built Latin bartender’s eyes immediately upon us. But I quickly realized he didn’t recognize Mia when he asked me what my “girlfriend” wanted to drink. It’s not that she has Beyonce-level fame or anything, but most people recognize Mia now and know that she’s married to Paul (a famous actor in his own right). Mia seemed to enjoy the anonymity, though, and before I could correct the bartender, she asked him for two gin martinis and took a seat at the bar.   \nBut after a moment her playful smile was replaced with a startled look.   \n“That bad having me as a boyfriend?” I teased.  \nShe whispered. “I just realized when I sat down that I forgot to wear...underwear...”  \nGlancing at her barstool,  it was impossible not to notice just how short that tight dress was. Indeed, if my angle were only a few degrees different, I’d have a clear view of Mia’s pussy. To my surprise, I felt my heart race at the sight—apparently my heart didn’t get the memo that I’m gay. Then again, I’ve always had a penchant for things taboo, regardless of gender. After a glance that lasted a beat too long, I looked up to find the bartender staring at us. His smile seemed to have something more to it than mere professionalism. Had he heard us? Was he smiling because he knew a few feet away from him, Mia wasn’t wearing anything under that dress?   \nFeeling a mixture of creepiness and confusion by the fact that I’d just been picturing Mia’s pussy (smooth and hairless, I estimated), I switched my attention to the beautiful view of the bartender as he expertly made our drinks. My mood began to lift at the sight of his arms and the way he moved that shaker. His biceps were practically bursting out of his tight sleeves...and his ass…its round thickness would even get a nun’s heart racing. As I involuntarily imagined my mouth buried in it, Mia raised her eyebrow like a clairvoyant. “It’s like you’ve already healed from your breakup.” I laughed and told her even in my darkest moments, that part of me is incapable of shutting off.   \n“He looks straight....but do you think...?” she whispered.   \nI couldn’t help but smile. “Shall we find out?”   \n“This will be fun,” Mia said as the 20-something handed us our drinks. He oozed masculine bro-ness, but I had experienced enough in life to realize that particular vibe didn’t guarantee heterosexuality...particularly in LA. Sometimes the more masc the guy, the more he can’t resist cock.   \n“Busy night?” I asked him, beginning my interrogation with some banal warmup.  \n“Nah, it’s been dead.”  \n“Three shots then,” I said.  \nHis penetrating brown eyes looked surprised when I signaled the third would be for him.   \n“Oh, are you not allowed....?” I motioned towards the busty brunette working at the other side of the bar talking to the other only customer.  \nHe didn’t appear to like my inference that he had to answer to someone. Did I sense some fragility to this man’s sense of masculinity?  \n“Oh, Ollie, I have a feeling he can do whatever he wants,” Mia said, being well-versed in massaging male egos.  \nHe poured three shots and gave a confident smile that all but screamed “I fucked that brunette and could again at any time.” As I took a sip of my martini, I decided it was the truth, not bravado. The martini was exceptional, by the way. I licked my lips and smiled at the handsome bartender who I was leaning towards being straight. I couldn’t help but feel even more turned on by him. We always want what we can’t have, I suppose.   \n“I’m Lalo,” he said as he distributed the shots.  \nThe three of us exchanged a glance and instinctually raised our shots and downed them. At that moment, Lalo’s brunette fuck buddy looked over and waved at him.  \n“Where’s mine?” she asked with mock anger.  \n“Sorry, one sec,” Lalo said to us as he quickly poured two more shots. He gave one to the busty girl and they shared a flirty smile before they downed them.  \nI looked over at Mia whose eyes were also fixed on Lalo. I couldn’t help but wonder if my pantyless friend might be wet. Why did my mind keep going there?!  \n“Seems like a fun place to work,” I said when he returned.  \n“It has its benefits,” he answered with a mischievous grin.  \n“God, the number of romances I had back in the day when I worked in restaurants.” Mia chimed in, getting straight to the point.   \n“Romance? Not sure I’ve had any of that here,” Lalo said.   \n“Really? You and the brunette don’t have a whole Tim and Dawn--will they won’t they thing going on?” I asked.  \n“Who?” he asked.  \nMia laughed and explained, “Don’t mind Ollie, he only likes to use references most people won’t get. He means two co-workers who are always...tempted to be something more....”  \n“She’s not exactly the type that tempts me,” Lalo said. That was a surprise....though not as surprising as the lingering glance he gave me. As I re-assessed my theory on him, I felt my cock twitch in my pants.  \n“You prefer blondes?” I volleyed back hoping for some clarity.   \n“Sometimes,” he said, offering Mia a glance. His eyes moved downward, towards her very tight, very short dress. Ballsy...especially since he thought I was her boyfriend. After a loaded beat, he regressed to a less flirty, but equally playful tone.  \n“Can I try out my new recipes on you two?”   \n“Sure,” I said. As he turned to grab a bottle and get to work, I got an even  better look at his ass. My mind now moved on from sticking my face in it to slapping it with my cock. Mia, meanwhile, looked at him like a difficult math problem.  \n“It’s 2023. Maybe he likes both,” I whispered.  \n“Does that even really exist?” she asked.  \n“What do you mean? You’ve hooked up with girls!”  \n“Right but...I don’t know. Girls are more open-minded than guys.”  \n“Deep down guys are just as open minded, trust me,” I said.  \n“Maybe you wish you could be...open-minded with him?” She said with a teasing grin.  \n“Not the worst way to get over a breakup. But what about you?”   \n“What about me?! I’m married,” she said.  \n“Of course, but something had your mind reflecting on old restaurant romances. There’s no shame in it....even if you are married to Paul.”  \nMia considered this. “I’d be lying if I said I didn’t sometimes miss hooking up with random hot guys like that. And back in the day, I would’ve fucked him by the second shift...But I’m very satisfied with Paul...as  most of the world now understands why, ” she said wryly.   \nMia was referring to a certain Paparazzi photo that went viral of Paul jogging in sweatpants. Within an hour, all of Twitter knew how well-endowed he was. Gay Twitter, in particular,  went crazy over his massive cock....but despite such a flattering attribute, I don’t particularly like Paul. I try to never reveal this to Mia, of course, and I’ve tried many times to change my opinion...but he’s one of those straight guys that has almost nothing to say when gay guys are around, probably because he knows how many men are fond of him. Whenever I see the cocky bastard, he offers me two or three words tops paired with a slightly judgy expression that seems to scream, “you’d better not masturbate to the thought of me tonight.” Of course, in a fucked up way, I’ve sadly proven the bastard correct a couple of times by involuntarily shooting my load to the thought of his beautiful cock in my mouth.  I’m only human, after all. But his lack of personality prevented Paul from ever becoming a permanent fixture in my fantasies.   \n“Anyway, I’m just living vicariously through you,” Mia said. “Think of all the sex you’re going to have in the next couple months.”  \nI smiled and meant it. Or maybe the alcohol was starting to hit me. But as often happens with breakups, my excitement turned to nostalgia.   \n“Five years with Noah...and the sex never stopped being hot,” I said and in that moment I could taste his cum. None had ever tasted sweeter than his.  Would any guy ever really be able to replace him? Had he already replaced me?  \nClearly reading my thoughts, Mia chimed in,  “I’m sure you’ll pick it all right back up. In fact, you should start tonight.” She cast her eyes on Lalo as he worked on making the latest drinks.   \n“He likes blondes, remember? Besides, right now I only want to look, not touch. It’s still too soon.”  \n“Bullshit. Take a chance with him. It might be just what you need.” Mia said. I shot her a look as Lalo returned with two bourbon drinks.  \n“My take on an old-fashioned,”  he said, as he placed them in front of us, quite proud of himself I might add.  \n“Ollie, you’ve barely touched your martini,” Mia said.  \nI quickly downed it, hoping it would calm my nerves.   \n“Your boyfriend’s impressive,” Lalo said to Mia.  \n“Oh, he’s actually not my boyfriend--” Mia started, priming herself up to play matchmaker.  \n“I’m her husband,” I said, beating her to the punch and taking her hand in my own.  \nLalo smiled with a devilish look in his eyes. “Cute couple.”  \nThis man was clearly an expert in flirting with total deniability. Was he into me? Or Mia? Or maybe he just knew how to wrack up tips...whatever the case, there was something undeniably sexy about him. The ass, the arms, that smile. I returned to my sexual fantasy, but gone was Noah. Now it was Lalo’s thick cock spurting out the most delicious cum I’d ever tasted. My inhibitions were quickly calling it a day and being replaced by liquid courage. Likewise, Mia was practically moaning as she sipped Lalo’s old-fashioned.  \n“How does it taste?” he asked her with a look that I imagine made her pussy twitch in its own right.  \n“Uh, very good....I might have to change up my usual order. I love this flavor”  \n“I get a lot of compliments on my flavor,” he said with a wink. Who did this guy think he was winking at my wife?!  \nWhen we finished our drinks, Lalo asked if we wanted to taste his mojito. He got excited as he said it was his favorite drink to make, but then frowned as he glanced around and then at his female co-worker still chatting away at the other end of the bar. .  \n“Fuck. She didn’t stock the bar with everything I need.”  \nI nodded with a slight relief. I was feeling over my limit and didn’t want to do anything I’d regret. But Mia clearly had a plan.   \n“Oh, well, if you need to go get more stuff, don’t worry about us. We’ll be fine here by ourselves for a bit. We’ll even pitch in if you get a rush ” Mia said.  \n“Thanks, but it’ll take a couple trips.”  \n“For a mojito--?” I started but Mia interrupted me.   \n“Why doesn’t my husband lend you a hand then?”   \nLalo looked at me, grateful for the offer and glanced in my direction.   \n“You’ll help him, won’t you honey?” Mia took my hand and leaned in coquettishly. Our eyes met as she leaned in even closer. How far was she going to take this? Another inch and our lips would be touching. I broke the tension with my response (probably Mia’s plan the whole time).  \n“Sure, happy to help,” I said, apprehensive but undeniably curious about this little field trip.   \n“Thanks.” he said, as he walked out from behind the bar.  \nI shot Mia a look. It clearly wasn’t that I wasn’t into it, but her being the architect of it all....something about it felt like one’s mother calling up and asking your crush to go out with you. Only I wasn’t entirely convinced this crush even liked guys. .   \nBut things got more confusing as soon as we walked into the storage closet.  \n“You and your wife...are you open?” he asked.  \n“You mean...?”  \n“Do you allow each other to fool around?”  \nI smiled. “So you want to hook up with my wife?”  \n“Yeah, I’d be into that....but I was actually asking...about you.”  \n“Sorry, but are you bi?”  \n“No, I’m straight,” he said.  \n“I’m pretty sure you lose your straight club membership for things exactly like what you’re proposing,” I said.  \n“I’m biologically straight, trust me,” Lalo said with no apparent irony or amusement. “But I do get turned on by a particular kind of guy,” he said.  \nThe basic illogic of it all didn’t deter me. “And what kind of guy is that?” I asked.   \n“A hot guy married to a hot woman.”  \n“Why’s that?”  \n“I don’t know. I always have this urge...” he paused. “To get the married guy hard for me while his sexy wife is right there.”  \n“Ah, so you’ve found that a lot of guys in straight relationships get hard for you?”  \n“It’s the guys who shouldn’t get hard that always get the hardest”   \n“You mean like this?” I asked and showed him the outline of my bulge in my tightening pants.  \nHe stared at it, a little surprised by my brazenness. But then he licked his lips.  \n“Exactly like that. That big married dick looks pretty fucking hard.”  \nI glanced at his pants which had been tight even with a flaccid dick. But now I could see his thick Latin cock growing by the second. I felt a surge of confidence.  \n“If I’m being honest, my cock hasn’t been soft since I entered your bar.” He loved this. I continued, “Must make you feel tough...getting a straight guy who has everything to look your way. Getting his sexy wife to look at you, too. Did you know she’s not wearing any panties?”  \n“Of course I did. Sluts always like to be looked at. Do you like that I made your wife wet?”  \nHe was clearly trying to be the alpha, to hold the power in this dynamic. I cleared my throat.  \n“I think you like to be looked at, too. Perhaps worshiped is a better word.”   \nHe chuckled. “If people, like your wife, want to worship me, I’m okay with that. How bad do you want to worship me? ”  \nAt that moment, I recalled this man knew nothing about me and I could be whatever I wanted to be in his presence. I decided to put kind, sensitive Ollie aside--the Ollie that Noah left-- and let my fantasies take the driver’s seat for once.  \n“I don’t worship. I’m an agnostic at best.”  \nLalo looked at me slightly confused.  \n“But, if I must admit it, I will: I get an urge for a certain kind of guy, too.”  \n“Oh yeah?”  \n“Yeah,” I said, as I started to unbutton my pants to his surprise. My dick was practically ready to tear my boxer briefs.   \n“I get hard for guys who think they’re tough...who get off on being macho...but deep down aren’t macho at all. You know what I like to do to those kind of guys?” I said as I lowered underwear and let my hard cock finally flop out.   \n“What’s that?” He asked, sounding a little less confident. His eyes, however, didn’t leave the sight of my uncut cock.  \n“I like to fuck them raw, Lalo.”   \nHe wasn’t expecting that one. It took him a moment to process what I said.  \n“Oh, I don’t...I only top--” he said in his increasingly insecure tone.  \nI interrupted him. “Why don’t you take down your pants and show me that ass I’ve been looking at all night?”  \nHe looked like he was going to fight me but after a moment, he started to unbutton his pants without a word.   \n“Take off your shirt, too,” I said.  \nHe pulled off his t-shirt revealing his beautiful chest. Then he lowered his jeans revealing a fucking huge bulge in his tight boxer briefs. The outline of the thick head of his cock was wet with pre-cum.   \n“Looks like I’m making you wet.”   \nHe looked nervous. Had I pushed too far? I quickly realized I was pushing just right when he lowered his underwear, releasing that thick Mexican sausage. It couldn’t have been harder and its wet tip was soaked with precum.   \n“That’s a good lad. Now turn around.” He obeyed and gave me a beautiful view of his muscular round ass--the definition of a bubble butt.  He looked back at me and practically whispered.  \n“ Your cock...it looks like it could hurt. I’m not sure I want--”  \n“Let’s be honest,” I said. “You’re more ready for it than you’re letting on, aren’t you?”  \nHe looked a little embarrassed.  \n“When you’re wasted and no one’s home, you think about getting fucked, don’t you, Lalo?”  \n“....I guess I’ve always wondered what it felt like.” He couldn’t help but stroke his cock as he said it.  \n“You finger that tight hole of yours, don’t you?” I asked.  \nSuddenly his embarrassment turned into a look of pleasure. My hunch was right: the dominator wanted to be dominated. He bent over and showed me his tight asshole.  \n“Yeah, I finger it. I cum hardest when there’s something in there.....”  \nI walked toward him, my dick throbbing in anticipation.   \n“How bad do you want this?” I asked.  \n“Fuckin bad. I need that hard cock you fuck your wife with,” Lalo said.  \nWhen he said this, I couldn’t help but picture something I’d never considered...my cock inside of Mia. In a flash, I saw it all. Her perky big tits, her round ass, and a look of ecstasy on her face as I entered her tight pussy without a condom....I didn’t know what was happening. Had Lalo’s fantasy somehow entered my own mind? I quickly tried to distract myself.  \n“I don’t have any lube. Get on your knees,” I commanded.  “I’m gonna fuck your face before I fuck your ass. I need you to get my cock nice and wet.”  \nLalo obediently got on his knees and licked his lips. “I’ve been picturing your sexy wife’s lips around your cock all night,” he said, the image again entering my own consciousness. It all felt so against the gay best friend code so before he could say anything more, I shoved my cock in his mouth. He stroked his thick dick as he gagged on my cock.  \nI tried to focus on that but before I knew it, I heard myself say, “Suck it as good as my wife does.” He moaned, both of us getting even more turned on.  \nHe wrapped his hands around my ass as I shoved my dick in and out of his mouth. I obliged his eager hands and fucked his face harder, precum already seaping out of my dick into his appreciative mouth.   \n“Are you gonna swallow my load as good as my slutty wife does?” I asked him.  \nHe moaned approval.  \n“Do you like worshiping this cock? Mia fucking loves this cock. Every time she puts it in her mouth she can’t help but rub her wet clit just like you’re rubbing that cock of yours. Do you like how I fuck your face just like I’m going to fuck hers later?”  \nThe question was too much for him and he blew his load right there. It landed all over my leg and hips and the feel of his warm jizz coupled with the bizarre thought of Mia swallowing my cum pushed me over the edge. My thick cock spurt out so much cum that Lalo choked.   \nIn that same ecstatic moment, I looked up to see Mia standing in the door, snapping me back to reality.  \nWe stared at one another awkwardly. Neither one of us could break eye contact. How long had she been there?!   \nAfter what felt like ages, she smiled her regular smile. I decided she must have just walked in....why would it have to be awkward? In her mind I was just fulfilling what she hoped I would. But why did I feel so strange? She managed a laugh and I faked one back, telling her we should probably get going. She offered to call an uber as I wiped Lalo’s cum off of me. He smiled and said the drinks were on him.  \n“They were delicious” I said, realizing just how tipsy I was.  \n“You were tastier,” he said with a smile. “Oh, and that was hot with your wife watching us.” Perhaps she’d been there longer than I’d hoped.   \nThe rest of the night was a blur. I vaguely remember the Uber ride where Mia and I talked as we normally did, but not much about what had just happened. I tried to apologize, but she stopped me, insisting she was so glad I got some action and not to feel weird about her seeing me naked. As she got out of the uber for the night, I couldn’t help but look at the outline of her tight dress, barely covering her round ass. Suddenly, I felt a rush of excitement knowing she wasn’t wearing panties. As she walked away, I couldn’t help but picture her in that doorway watching me and Lalo. Did it make her wet? Did she...touch herself? I immediately tried to push the thought out of my head but despite my best efforts, my dick grew hard in the Uber.  As soon as I walked in my front door, I unzipped my pants and started to stroke my throbbing member right in the hallway. It didn’t take long before I had cum all over my pants. The last gift Noah got me actually...now stained from the most confusing ejaculation of my gay life. \n\nCheck back for part 2, when I next saw Mia....and her actor husband with the huge cock...", 't2_mai183q2', 'I (M31) hooked up with a sexy straight-identifying bartender (M25) while my best friend watched (F30).', 't3_14dzvdx', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/BiStoriesGoneWild/comments/14dzvdx/i_m31_hooked_up_with_a_sexy_straightidentifying/')

Hopefully this post will motivate you to speak up and NOT shy away next time you encounter a creep in a bar/restaurant/venue. \n\nI was with some friends of mine at a local music venue watching my boyfriend’s band perform. It’s a smaller venue, but it gets packed and crazy, especially during punk shows. I’m a huge fan of the mosh pit, so I will often be moving and shoving people in the middle of the floor. I feel very safe and secure in my ability to do this. \n\nThis particular night, the pit was quite rowdy and I ended up stumbling back into the crowd. There was a man behind me who at first I thought was trying to catch me since he put his hand on my back (a fairly normal occurrence when you are stumbling/falling.) however, he then proceeded to slide his arm across the front of my stomach (I was wearing a short, cut-off shirt) and pull me against his body. \n\nI will admit, I was extremely uncomfortable and I wanted to run away. But this same thing had happened to one of my good friends who was with me only a few weeks ago, so I felt my anger boil over. I grabbed this man’s arm and yanked it off of me, and I SLAPPED his hand with all the strength I could muster. I looked him directly in the eye and told him, “watch your fucking hands, dude.” \n\nAt first, I wasn’t going to say anything else, but my friends and boyfriend encouraged me to let the bartender know. I saw the same man creeping on other girls around my age, (21F for reference, he seemed to be around 30ish) and I knew it was time for him to go. \n\nAnd y’all, they kicked him out IMMEDIATELY. No questions asked. As soon as I said he was touching people, they got security and threw his ass out on the street with the rest of the trash. It made my night, and I am extremely thankful to my friends and the staff for being so incredibly supportive! \n\nLook out for each other out there, loves &lt;3', 't2_5aocowp8', 'The Bartender Kicked Him Out!', 't3_13zc3uv', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/13zc3uv/the_bartender_kicked_him_out/')

It all starts with her saying, "You know compared to most around here you ain’t too bad."  From there it goes in different directions.  Sometimes they flirt with each other all night, sometimes he leaves around 5pm.  She talks a lot of gossip of things around town: a guy who died in the lighthouse whose widow says she hears his voice, a guys who sleeps out back claims there’s gold under the lighthouse, ‘Big ol’ Dumb Jerry’ who tried to teach himself to swim and disappeared, and on and on.
