Since I had quit drinking in March, I’ve felt like absolute shit. I felt depressed and sluggish and foggy, and didn’t experience the pink cloud everyone talks about after they quit. Then I started having really bad memory issues. I would get home from an outing and completely forget where I had just returned from, conversations with people were completely forgotten, and I was struggling to just make it through the day so I could pass out and sleep. Then, I became suicidal so I talked to my psychiatrist about antidepressants and she prescribed me Zoloft, which had no effect. \n\nMy blood work came back this week and I was diagnosed with folate deficiency syndrome, a type of anemia related to folic acid, and was completely depleted of Vitamin D2. This is prevalent in pregnant women, the elderly in early stages of dementia, and alcoholics. The doctor explained that heavy, consistent intake of alcohol blocked folic acid receptors and kept the body from absorbing the necessary nutrients. This can lead to lethargy, forgetfulness, weakness in your muscles, etc. and, in very rare cases, can cause hearing loss. \n\nI had started going Deaf two years ago, and a cause was never determined. My heart plummeted. \n\nI was prescribed heavy doses of both Vitamin D2 and folic acid and within 2 days felt immensely better. I had more energy, the mental fog was gone, and my depression started lifting. \n\nI was so sure I had avoided any consequences of my drinking because I wasn’t exhibiting symptoms of cirrhosis or anything, but I had indeed done some damage. Fortunately it’s reversible at this stage, and I’ll be doing blood work every three months for the next year until my levels are stable again. However, I will not get my hearing back. I have a MRI scheduled for next week to see if there is physical damage to my auditory nerves or frontal lobe. \n\nI guess my point is that alcohol can damage us in so many ways, ways we don’t even consider. Alcohol is a poison and it destroys us from the inside out. This is why I will not drink, and IWNDWYT!\n\nEdit: wow I didn’t expect so many people to respond to this! There were a lot of questions I wasn’t able to answer in the moment so here’s a brief rundown of the most common questions asked\n\nDaily intake: two bottles of wine and two or three cocktails (by ounce, about 85 standard drinks a week)\n\nThe bloodwork wasn’t just for liver and kidney function, I asked them to check everything since I hadn’t seen my doctor for a check up in ages\n\nI noticed my hearing starting to change about two and a half years ago and saw my PCP for a hearing test, but they said it was normal. I repeated this three times before they sent me to an audiologist who conducted several more tests, and through a bone conductance test and speech recognition test identified the source of the hearing loss. I started using hearing aids last August \n\nThe depression and suicidal thoughts were initially believed to be related to my bipolar disorder, which is why it took a bit between quitting and getting blood work done to figure out that it was likely nutrient related rather than chemically related\n\nThey’ve started me on 50,000 units of vitamin D2 and folic acid (not sure of dosage) for 90 days \n\nThank you all for your support and encouragement in your comments!

Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.  \nIt doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!  \n\\---  \n\\*\\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\\*\\* Today we don't set out \\*trying\\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \\*not to drink\\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!  \nWhat happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.  \n\\*\\*What this is:\\*\\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.  \n\\*\\*What this isn't:\\*\\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories.

In my last marriage I had three step kids but only every other weekend so I could “hide it”.   I certainly did not wake up on time most weekends though.   Fast forward to now, one of the reasons something “clicked” in my head was getting the news that I needed to take custody of my niece.  Full time.  By myself.  She got a hold of her parents methodone treatment thinking it was a regular bottle of water and nearly died at 8 years old.  This ball got rolling around the same time that I was realizing I had a problem, but every time I tried to stop for a day, I would detox the next. I was in that vicious cycle of day ones trying to get to day 4.  But I couldn’t stay in bed all day weekends with her around.  I couldn’t sleep in when she had to go to school.  I couldn’t let her cycle of disappointment and foster homes continue.  I had to relearn how to handle stress without alcohol again.  And I had to learn to believe on myself again.   One day at a time.  \nHave you been sober for 30 days or longer?   Do you love to serve?   If I can do it, you can too!

Because of this and the season I am most interested in making a good carbonated drink.\n\nI have been reading that higher ABV makes it hard for the liquid to hold onto the Co2, making the max ABV for a decently carbonated cocktail likely around 13-15%. Some say as low as 4-5%. Additionally higher ABV effervescence may create an unpleasant sensation.\n\nI've seen an episode of How To Drink where Greg carbonates some different cocktails in a small single use Co2 cartridge like soda stream. One cocktail was an old fashion and had to be pretty high ABV, probably closer to 26%. His experience was very unpleasant, I believe this is because of the style and ABV of the cocktail.\n\nMy curiosity regarding that Youtube episode is seeing this old fashion 'successfully' carbonate at a higher ABV, is how long would the drink hold onto this carbonation? Especially in a narrow vessel like a Collins.\n\nI want to make a carbonated cocktail around 22% ABV. My main question is do you think this can be pulled off?

My dad was one of these, and was drafted into service, and like so many other young men, was sent to Vietnam.\n\n\nMy Dad was fortunate in that he was studying to be a med tech (pathology) when he got drafted, so unbeknownst to him, he was already earmarked for deployment to a field hospital unit, and ended up being seconded to a major British hospital unit in Singapore. \n\n\nThe way he tells it, when he landed in Singapore, he was dropped at some dingy airfield at night, with no illumination and not a soul in sight. After about 10 minutes of wondering how fucked he was, a car pulls up and out steps a guy with a familiar accent, dressed in thongs (flip flops for the yanks), the classic short-shorts of the time, and from my best guess of the description, basically a short sleeved safari shirt.\n\n\n‘Evening mate, you (father’s name)?’\n\n‘Yeah mate.’\n\n‘Alright, jump in.’ \n\n\nThey get to chatting as they head out of the airstrip. Turns out stubby-shorts-safari man is Major Smith,  2ic of the hospital my dad’s to be stationed at and one of 3 Aussies seconded to it. Turns out Major Smith is just happy to have another Aussie around so there was no real standing on ceremony. He gives my Dad the lay of the land, what to watch out for with the locals and a (very relevant) warning about Singaporean beer, namely Tiger beer, which had chemically sterilized bottles and would almost certainly give you the runs if you drank it.\n\n\nAfter getting settled in, my Dad got to work and by all accounts, really enjoyed his service. He got a lot of practical training in his field and ended up coming out of it as a fully qualified lab tech.\nThere was, however, two major complaints. Being seconded to a British unit meant two things:\n\n-\tYou were eating at a British mess\n\n-\tYour only option for beer, unless you wanted to brave the liquid laxative known as Tiger beer, was lukewarm British beer.\n\n \nThe mess hall was so fucking bad that the Australian army actually gave all of their troopers an actual meat allowance in their pay so they could buy their own, because even Australian army administrators agreed that what the British were serving was basically unfit for human consumption and would give nothing but Anaemia to their soldiers due to the lack of iron. I’m not joking on this, there was an actual nutritional requirement table that the English food didn’t actually meet.\n\n\nAs you can also imagine on the beer front, as a red blooded Australian, the thought of having to deal with what he considered essentially room temperature dog water made his stomach churn.\n\n\nIn a bout of desperation, he ended up writing a letter to Carlton United Brewery’s predecessor (the guys who make the somewhat infamous Fosters, and what my Dad was really after, being Victoria bitter). In this letter, he just basically asked if there were any liquour stores or distribution centers in Singapore that stocked the good stuff, because he was just thoroughly sick of British beer and there weren’t any real alternatives. He posted the letter without any real expectations, other than maybe being able to pick up a couple of bottles some time in the future from a bottle shop. \n\n\nAbout 2 months pass, and the letter he sent is a dim memory. About half way through an otherwise ordinary shift, a disgruntled supply sergeant comes storming into the lab, asking for my dad and why the fuck there is a huge, fully stacked pallet personally addressed to him, currently taking up space in his supply store.\n\n\nA little confused, he and Major Smith, overhearing the conversation from his office, went down to investigate.\n\n\nWell, the supply Sergeant wasn’t wrong. There was a gigantic pallet sitting in the middle of the warehouse, wrapped in cardboard. Having absolutely no explanation for this, my Dad decided to peel off a section of carboard, and was greeted with a sight that would’ve made any Aussie weep with joy –\n \n\nThis pallet was stacked from bottom to top, about 7 foot high, with cartons of Victoria Bitter. Enough to get the entire hospital unit sloshed for the better part of a year. \n\n\nMajor smith was in awe – \n\n\n‘Mate, i don’t know what the fuck you did, but I think i’m in love right now.’ \n\n\nEven better than this was the surprise that they found at the center of the pallet, buried in magnificent beer -  A brand new refrigerator, with a note attached:\n\n\n‘No digger should be forced to drink warm British piss. Enjoy the beer’.\n \n\nTurns out one of the upper management at the brewery was handed my Dad’s letter, and he was utterly appalled. He basically considered the beer situation a warcrime and sprung into action to rectify the situation.\n\n\nSo for the rest of my Dad’s deployment, and probably for a long time after, the beer fridge was set up in the supply store, with anyone allowed access for a coin donation, and my father never had to drink British beer again.\n\n\n\n\n\nHope you guys enjoyed the story.

I’m here seeking advice for the next steps in my career path (based in CT). For the last six months I’ve been a tractor trailer driver (sideloader) at Pepsi, but the pay is not that good. I make about $24 an hour at 50 hours per week nets me about $1000 take home per week (hours are about 6am to 5pm, I clock 50hrs a week but really am out for 55hrs a week).\n\nLast week two amazing opportunities presented themselves to me and I’m conflicted on which direction to go. The whole reason I got my CDL in the first place was because I know the Director of public works for the town I grew up in. He finally called me and let me know there was a position available for me and that it was mine if I wanted. It pays $26 an hour my first year and then after the one-year anniversary of my start date it goes up to 33 an hour. The benefits are great and I get pension and all the good town benefits. I filled out all the paperwork, accepted the position and my start date is in about 3 weeks.\n\nA couple days after I accepted this position I got a call from another company - a liquor distributor. One day while I was out on the road for Pepsi I ran into one of the liquor distributor drivers and started picking his brain. I heard through coworkers that they made a lot of money and the benefits were great so I asked him a bunch of questions. We hit it off and he really liked me and saw that I had good hustle so he gave me the contact of an HR lady. The lady was super nice when I called and scheduled me for an interview about two weeks from now (10 days before i start the town job). She did say that they weren’t hiring drivers at the moment, but that there were a few guys that were about to retire there so my guess is they want to get me in for an interview just to feel me out for when the few dudes retire. I know that if I go in for the interview they will hire me when the time comes. The liquor distributor delivery guys gets paid by the day and by the case. They make 90k+ a year. Their benefits are really amazing too and they also get pension.\n\nAs a town worker, I know that I will get a little bit of overtime, but more-so in the winter time when I have to plow overnight. When I was talking to the liquor distributor driver, he told me that he works between 7 to 9 hours per day. My main concern if I choose the liquor delivery option is that my body will deteriorate quickly over time. It is definitely a more strenuous type of job having to handtruck a bunch of liquor into liquor stores in kegs up and downstairs and restaurants and whatnot. Whereas for the town job, I know for a fact that I will be able to work that job until I have to retire. Everyone who gets into the public works department retires there, but it seems like the drivers at the liquor distributor also work there until they retire. I am young now, so I know my body has many years of abuse left I can throw at it, but all in all I am super conflicted on which career path to take.

Let’s say he chugged a flask, which could be  from around 8-10 shots or 12 or however much he was able to get down in the period of the sinking, then had his last swigs few mins before the ship went down. After consuming that his BAC would be estimated a .33 or higher (which could be lethal for a non-drinker but I mean, he was a cook in the early 1900s, so he’d prolly built a tolerance, bad alcoholics can have 0.3 BACs and not be almost-dead drunk).

I’ve been irregularly obsessed with this story. \n\nHe survived 2hrs IN THE WATER, whilst treading, while others in lifeboats out of the water were dying from hypothermia.

But more so 2) from a lack of giving a damn while being sloshed. I was piss drunk and did a skinny dip when I was younger and much more fit in a frozen over lake and whilst everyone else screamed and ran to the shore to get out, I barely felt it, or was too drunk to care and the only thing that got me out of the water was my friends pulling me out. \n\n\n\nWhy does science “prove” alcohol speeds up hypothermia, yet it seems to have helped Mr. Joughin, and myself.\nIs it a willpower drive type- thing that alcohol gives you or was it just dumb luck.\n\n\n\n\nLet’s discuss.', 't2_61w1u8r2', 'Okay guys.

I said that I am very happy about his wedding, but I genuinely do not wish to be a waiter and that the staff hired for this wedding should be handling it, so me as a guest, can actually enjoy being a guest. He got mad, like, actually mad and said that He rarely asks me for anything, but I should just do it for him. I then told him that if he wants me to be a waiter, then he might as well not invite me and just ask someone else. He hung up and later texted me that I either "man up" or can consider myself not invited. I was surprised, because I\'ve never thought before, that He would stick up to such a weird tradition (while he\'s ignoring basically every other tradition during polish wedding). \n\nHere\'s where I might actually be the asshole, because I texted him back "I consider myself not invited then". Like it escalated all so quickly, I am now having like second, third and fourth thoughts about it all and that maybe this whole thing wasnt going to be as extreme as I pictured it and that I\'d just toss a bottle or two on the table from time to time and that would be it, but then I remembered when he exactly specified that I would be required to physically pour everyones drinks, like not just make sure there are full bottles on the table, but also pour everyones glass. \n\nAITA?

To keep myself from mentally craving a drink as often, I have made a rule to only buy/drink Steel Reserve (yes, the really SHIT tasting malt liq 42 oz that comes in a plastic bottle).

Also nice that it is dirt cheap so I save some money and it's like 8% so I feel the buzz quicker. \n\nMy family has been telling me to spend the extra cash on a decent quality brew because the cheap 40s are worse for your health due to impurities and whatnot. I figured ethanol is ethanol and the alc content is the greatest measure we can really use for caution when drinking. Sure it may not be distilled as well but I didn't think it would make much of a difference. \n\nAll in all, I probably will continue doing what I'm doing because I like how it is making me glorify drinking less.

This trek is nearly 15 hours long and while you can do it in a day, it’s better if you stop to rest. Having lived in Utah at one point in time, I was very eager to show him the natural hot springs in Spanish Fork. They are located deep in Diamond Fork Canyon and require a 45 minute hike from the parking lot. Still, we were both excited to get out and moving after 7 hours in the car. When we arrived at the first parking lot however, the gate was shut and locked tight. A sign taped to the metal read “Closed. Absolutely no access to hot springs. Fines $2000 max” or something to that nature. We were bummed. Covid had shut down many things and we figured that this was outside so there’s no way it was going to be closed! After some research on the government website, we discovered that a body had possibly been found in the springs and was likely the cause for the locked gate. \n\nSad and tired of sitting in the car, we drove back down the canyon road to find a spot to camp for the night. Most of the more established camp sites were closed due to Covid or were already taken for the night. This was fine since we prefer more dispersed camping anyway. So we picked a random road to turn on as we drove closer to exiting the canyon. Road 338. Most of the road was a well kept dirt road. We passed some promising spots near a creek and maybe 2 or 3 other people already set up for the night. We wanted to go a little further to see if there was anything with that wow factor. Sounds funny but some sites give off that “this is the one!” feeling. Finally we came to a dead end in the main road with a fire mitigation road to the right. At this very spot there was a strange boulder with some type of inscription on it, partially surrounded by a wooden fence. I had to investigate. The inscription read “Diamond Battle June 20 1866”. No way! A memorial for a battle that happened right here! A feeling of uneasiness and oddly, respect, washed over me. \n\nAfter traveling up the fire road and not finding what we were hoping for in a campsite, we decided to pick a spot by the small creek we passed on the way in. It was getting dark quickly but we set up our tent in no time at all and got a fire going. The creek was loud but peaceful. Though, ever since I read that inscription, I couldn’t shake this strange feeling. I’m not a paranoid person but I kept feeling on the edge of my seat. Like something was watching us from the woods just across the water. As the night grew darker, this feeling grew stronger. I decided I didn’t want to be in the open anymore and retreated to the tent to get some rest while my partner stayed up to enjoy the fire. I snuggled into our sleeping bag and exhaled comfortably, listening to the creek that was now much quieter and was a bit further from the tent. I started to drift off when I heard it. Soft chanting. Rhythmic drums. My eyes shot open. Was I really hearing that? I strained my ears to listen over the running water. I couldn’t quite get a clear sound but it was definitely there. This is when I noticed the ground was also rumbling. As if horses were stampeding down the road, 100 feet from our site. I didn’t know if I should get out to tell my partner but I had the strange feeling that if I said it out loud it would make it more true and that an army of spirits would spring from the trees and into our campsite. Before I could make the decision I was dead asleep. This was somehow the most peaceful slumber I have ever had. \n\nThe next morning, we packed up our tent and left no trace that we had ever spent the night by Little Diamond Creek. When I finally entered cell service, I did a google search of that memorial and Diamond Fork, Utah. It turns out there was a battle there between the Utes and the Mormon Militia and lives were lost on that mountain side. After reading this, I decided to tell my partner what I heard last night before falling asleep. I told him about the chanting and the drumming and even the stomping of horses. He looked at me in disbelief and said he heard the exact same thing. I guess I was only in the tent 10 minutes before he got spooked standing alone by the fire, hearing this distant chanting and drums. He came into the tent and experienced that same peaceful sleep I had. I feel as though we were being watched over by those Native Americans that lost their lives there. A strong but calm and protective presence. If you’re ever on Diamond Fork Road, I hope you visit and pay respects to the memorial of the Diamond Battle and maybe the spirits of the land will watch over you too.', 't2_gs0bopyy', 'Camping with ancient spirits', 't3_14sddvu', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/BackwoodsCreepy/comments/14sddvu/camping_with_ancient_spirits/'), ('14to104', '2023-07-07 19:08:01', 'Mediums', 't5_2wv33', "Is it common to see spirits as a medium with the naked eye?

Some people claim that the practitioner/we (or our soul) is/are basically god. Some other practitioners who claim to be very experienced like u/bassackwards42 (I’m not affiliated with him but I read his old comments) say that due to the divine spark, humans might be more than mere pawns on the stage. \n\nFor example he states that humans have dominion over spirits and that even at our weakest we have the potential to be stronger than even the strongest spirit, fae, demon or arch demon etc. and bind them with our will and gnosis, otherwise why would even the princes of hell come running to a puny human just because they were summoned by a small ritual? I actually like this perspective a lot even though I practice chaos magick and I don’t follow the Abrahamic religions. \n\nI don’t know if this perspective works with deities of other religions too but some people even claim humans are superior to gods in this way? I’ve not read much with this view except a few fringe comments that never spoke to me much before this but I find that it makes some sense to me. What do you all think? Are there any books with more detail on this? Do you agree with the idea of mankind having dominion over spirits and why or why not? Etc.\n\nI don’t like the idea of being dependent on any entities so I’ve mostly only been working with my own internal power and recognizing that god is within, mostly doing that instead of evoking external beings to do my will for me or anything.

I figured Halloween was probably the safest night to go out dressed up without fear of being ridiculed. I decided to go all out – I took off from work and decided to start the day by heading down to Macy’s.\n\nMy first stop was to the lingerie section to buy myself a new bra and some sexy panties to go with it. I meandered up the escalator to the women’s clothing section and picked out a sexy pink skirt and a tight top with a cute graphic print of Care Bears (LOL). I also treated myself to a pair of pink open-toed heels. I have super tiny feet for a guy (7 in men’s) and narrow, so finding a pair on the sale rack was easy enough. I paid for everything and then made my way down to the Mac counter for a makeover.I’m pretty comfortable doing this on my own, but felt this was enough of a special occasion to warrant having it done by a true professional. Sitting in the chair, the artist asked me what type of look I was going for – I told her let’s go for Halloween prostitute. She looked at me, clearly got the point, smiled and immediately started to work her magic with the brush. She taught me each step so I could replicate it when I got home. When she was done, I wanted to put my own cock in my own mouth – it looked so sexy! With my makeup done and the bag with my outfit in tow, I hurried out of Macy’s, hailed a cab, and headed back uptown.\n\nWhen I got home, I rushed into my apartment, started to run a hot bath, and stripped off all of my clothes. I live on a high floor and love leaving my blinds open because this guy across the way always stares even though he clearly tries to pretend that he’s not. I slipped into the tub and listened to some music as I gently cleaned my body. After a relaxing bath, I turned on the shower and shaved to ensure I’d be perfectly smooth for the evening’s festivities.\n\nHopping out of the shower, I started to work on my hair. I had been growing my hair out for a while at this point, so it’s naturally long and curly. I laid out all of the makeup I bought along with my brushes and got started on my face. By the end of it, I clearly saw Jenna in the mirror. I looked down at my bare nipples, reached over, grabbed my bra and put it on. I slipped two silicone breasts in and then gently slid my panties up my legs, over my girl stick, and up over both of my ass cheeks – my squats have definitely been paying off. Next, I put on my skirt, Care Bears shirt, and fishnets. I finished the outfit by slipping into my heels. I stood in front of the mirror and said, “hey girl!” I felt sexy and ready to head out. It was around 10pm, so the night was only starting to get busy.\n\nI walked out of my building confident as Jenna. I headed up the block to one of the sports bars in my neighborhood that I knew was having a Halloween party. At the door, the bouncer gave me an up and down and merely waved me into the bar – phew, no ID check. I went to the bar, ordered a bourbon on the rocks and whipped out my cell phone. I logged into Grindr to take a look, but nobody really piqued my interest. Suddenly, a shot glass gets pushed in front me, I look up and it’s one of the bartenders smiling. This guy was buff as fuck, had an adorable beard, and was 6’1” - 6’3”. At 5’5”, I could feel him towering over me. He leaned on the bar, kept smiling, looked at me and said, “thought you could use a shot.” Responding, I felt on the verge of squealing but was able to clearly articulate a “thank you.” He asked my name and if I was from the area. I told him that I lived nearby. He was curious as to why I was out alone, which I immediately read as him hitting on me so I decided to go all out on being Miss Flirtatious. At that point, I took the shot and placed the glass on the counter complete with a lipstick mark. He looked down, picked up the shot glass, and what he did next turned me on beyond belief – he held it in his massive hands, stuck his tongue out, and licked the rim where my lipstick was. I think he felt all of the oxygen in my body flow out and my knees shake, because it was the hottest thing I’d seen a guy do, especially for me as Jenna. The bartender at the other end of the bar yelled out, “B, need your help.” He looked at me and said, “You’ll stay, right?” I said, “Of course, B” to which he replied, “It’s Brandon, everybody just calls me B. See you later, Jenna.”\n\nI chilled at the bar while Brandon helped the other bartender at the opposite end of the bar. I nursed my bourbon and noticed how Brandon kept his eyes on me. He’d wink at me every now and then, which had my girl stick twitching like crazy. After about 20 minutes, he made his way back to my end of the bar. Standing in front of me, he unbuttoned the shirt he was wearing and took it off revealing a tank t-shirt that only further made his muscles known. As he shifted to toss the shirt behind him, his tank came up a little and I saw the trail heading toward something I really wanted at this point. I think he caught me staring at his crotch, which was confirmed when he grabbed his crotch, smiled at me, and winked. He laughed, so I laughed but mainly out of a state of anxiety about what could happen. At the same time, I knew he was bartending so it would probably just be a game leaving my pussy untouched.I checked in on Grindr again, but once again found men who were not of interest to me, plus I had Brandon stare at. I watched Brandon serving the other girls and noticed he kept looking back at me almost as if to assure me that I was the one he was most interested in. The bar got busy and Brandon was serving all of the people who had come in since I’d gotten there, but he still made it a point to make eye contact with me every now and then and to stop by to check-in on me. A little after 11:30pm, Brandon swung over and said, “hey, I gotta take my dinner break in five, you up for a walk?” I don’t think I said anything audibly and merely nodded my head. He smiled and said, “great, meet in the alley on the side of the bar.”\n\nAt that, I downed the rest of my bourbon and headed to the alley. It was really much of an alley by New York City standards as much as it was the small side door that the kitchen staff probably used to haul in supplies and to take out trash. I leaned against the cleaner of the two walls and waited. Brandon came out with his tank on and a pair of sweats. Did I mention how much I love a man in sweats? Anyway, he walked right up to me, leaned down and kissed me on the cheek. I could feel myself turn red. He said, come on, I live just around the corner. I froze. He grabbed my hand, and I was still frozen because this guy wanted to take me to his apartment, which got me nervous because Brandon has no idea that I’m a boy underneath this outfit and that I have a raging hard on in my panties. He smiles and says, “come on, just some Halloween fun.”\n\nWe walked into his building and headed up two flights of stairs, which was remarkably easy given my heels. He unlocked his apartment door and invited me into what was a relatively nice apartment albeit unorganized to the extreme. He told me to sit on the couch and that he’d be right back with some drinks. He came back with two drinks and had added a pair of devil horns to the top of his head. I giggled, but he didn’t. He put the two glasses down, asked me if I wanted a sip. I picked up a glass and as I did, he came to stand right in front of me. I gulped a heavy sip of the drink and could see that he had developed a raging hard on. I gulped air. As I put the glass down, he leaned in toward me and suddenly grabbed my hair, pulling on it rather hard. I yelped, which seemed to turn him on. He said, “I was hoping a sexy little bitch girl like you was going to come in tonight. Daddy needs his needs taken care of. You gonna be a good girl and help?” I couldn’t produce words so I just nodded. He smiled, pulled my hair back and spit on my tits. I was so turned on, but also scared as fuck.Brandon pulled on my hair, while he grabbed my hand and told me to rub his cock. I could feel his cock growing. It was decent length, but insanely thick and he had really big balls. He looked down at me and said, “Suck it, bitch.” At that, he released my hand so that he could yank his sweats down. His big white cock flopped out and he immediately pushed my head toward his cock. \n\nI took the entire thing in my mouth on the first go, which immediately had him moaning and calling me “good girl.” I kept bobbing up and down on his cock, used my tongue to tease his cock head and played with his balls with my hands and tongue. He ripped – literally ripped – off his tank exposing a well-defined six pack and these awesome pecs. As I sucked his cock, he flexed his pecs, which turned me on so much. I looked up and asked him, “Do you like it Daddy?” He said, “Fuck yes, my little bitch does a good job sucking Daddy’s cock.” I continued sucking him and noticed that his hand was fondling my silicone breast through the Care Bears shirt. He said, “Daddy wants to play with Jenna’s tits.” Once again, I was fucking terrified because this guy has no clue that I am boy – albeit a femboy. Before I can say anything, his hand thrusts through the neck of my shirt and it’s too late. He pulls back his hand with a silicone breast, looks at me and then the breast, drops the breast, pushes my head off of his cock and then roughly pulls up my t-shirt. He looks down and tells me to lift my ass off the couch. I tell him that I’m comfortable like this, but he demands it. \n\nOnce I lift my ass just a bit, he immediately reaches down and yanks my skirt off.At this point, my panties are exposed with a massive wet spot from the precum he caused! He clearly understood what was going on at this point. I started to say, “I’m sorry,” but he grabbed me by one of my arms, forced me up, and yanked me over to his bed. He forced me face down over the side of the bed and said, “You fucking little faggot bitch. You think this is funny? Getting a straight guy hard, sucking his cock, and not telling him you’re a fucking dude?” He kept me in this position with his forearm against my back. I seriously thought he was going to beat the shit out of me. I started crying and telling him how sorry I was and that I wouldn’t tell anyone. He just kept saying “faggot bitch” and then he said, “fucking faggot wants dick on Halloween. Ok, faggots gonna get it but not how she wants it.” I noticed how he said she and realized I had no idea where this was going. \n\nSuddenly, he yanked down my panties, I heard him spit, and then I felt his cock up against my smooth tight hole. I said, “Hold on, we need a condom.” He said, “Not tonight sweetheart, you’re going home with me in you.” He held me down harder and then slammed his cock in me. He was like a dog in heat pounding my pussy. He started saying things like, “mmmm, tight pussy” and “that’s a good girl, Daddy’s gonna get your preggy on Halloween.” I was crying but also incredibly turned out. He kept pounding my ass, grunting, and moaning. I couldn’t hold it anymore, I was going to cum. I yelled out, “I’m cumming Daddy,” to which he replied “Mmmm you fucking whore, yes let it out you bitch.” I came into his comforter as I was still face down on the bed. I felt him picking up his pace, his massive balls slapping against my ass, and sweat dripping off of his muscles onto my back. He said, “I’m gonna fucking drop my cum in you bitch, I gonna give you my babies… you ready? You fucking ready?” I merely replied with, “please Daddy.” At this point he leaned over my body holding my shoulders as he slammed his cock in me. \n\nHe moaned and said, “Here it comes, Daddy’s cumming in your tight pussy… fuck, I’m cumming… ahhhhh.” He collapsed on my back and continued to breathe heavily for several minutes. He got up and pulled his cock from my ass, slapped my ass, and said, “get dressed faggot and get the fuck out.” I was so startled that I got my shit together as fast as possible and slipped my clothes back on while he watched from the kitchen counter sipping his drink. He said, “I like that pussy and I like thinking about you walking around with me swimming inside.” He walked over, slapped my face and said, “You’re lucky I only fucked the shit out of you, so after tonight don’t come back to the bar.” I nodded, slipped on my heels, stood up and ran out. I headed home as quickly as I could.\n\nThis was a fucking scary experience, but I’ve fantasized about it for the past three nights and have even walked by the bar a few times.', 't2_eguvkphe5', 'Get fucked by the bartender on Halloween after he discovered I was crossdressing', 't3_14v6uq9', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/cdstoriesgonewild/comments/14v6uq9/get_fucked_by_the_bartender_on_halloween_after_he/'), ('14txdau', '2023-07-08 02:38:27', 'u_Less-Morning-8163', 't5_37tt7k', '', 't2_8dc2k1w1', 'Cold IPA -

Below are some of my thoughts, I regret not writing down my thoughts as I was drinking but the experience was too special to be on my phone. \n\nThe Yama had a great nose very floral and fruity and is an easy drinker. The Hibiki was a touch downgrade from Yama, but still quite nice. Somehow burns a lot on the way down. After some delicious dinner, we headed to his collection and my jaw dropped at the amount of goodies there was. The Redbreast 27yr has been my dream bottle ever since trying the 12 year cs and lustau, and hoping one day I could try a sip of this. Today my dreams came true and he opened this unopened redbreast to try! It was honestly the best dram of the night, so buttery and creamy, salty caramel, dark fruits, oaky, and packed so much flavour and complexity! The finish was so long, satisfying and delectably smooth. After, I was offered to try a ‘mystery’ pour, which I had to accept. The nose was slightly peaty, fruity and musty, and the taste was sweet with layers of complexity. It was revealed to be a 59 year Glen Grant bottled in 1954! I couldn’t tell it was that old and that expensive, to me it just tasted like a really really good scotch, but imho the juice inside is def not worth the price it goes for. Then I was poured one of his personal favs; springbank 15, which had a really funky and interesting nose, with a fruity and nutty taste.

I think the bar man sussed me out, guessed I was trying to hide it and after my second order,  just gave me the samedrink for the whole evening by asking “same again?” It was very smooth despite me being stressed about how I would tackle the situation prior to going. I should probably add that I had 7 between 5pm and 23:30. \n\nI got home last night and Googled if 0% Gin and Tonic was okay during pregnancy. Google being Google told me that it was terrible and presented me with the worst cases.

Every year me and the boys get together for a long weekend, and it's become a tradition that i make a hot sauce from my home grown chillies. I try to make something different every time. Now, in this group, there's a bit of a meme of drinking rum and cokes - lots of us really do like rum, and a rum and coke is a simple thing to get a round of when you're at a bar and can't be bothered to remember everyone's order.\n\nSo, i am thinking about making a rum and coke hot sauce.

And it doesn't have to amazingly good - it's more important to be unusual than good in this situation!\n\nAny ideas?\n\nI'd like to start with toasted or roasted chillies, because i like the way they taste anyway, and i think that dark, smoky, flavour would work well with the theme anyway. Sound reasonable?\n\nThen i'd grind up the chillies and dissolve them in rum. I'm thinking of using Wood's navy rum - it's 57% abv, and has a really punchy flavour.\n\nThere could be room for some muscovado sugar here - adds sweetness, but also a lot of deep, dark notes. Takes the sauce in a barbecue direction?\n\nBut how would i handle the coke angle?\n\nThe flavour of coke is roughly a spice and citrus blend - cinnamon, vanilla, nutmeg, lemon and orange oils. So i could just stick those in. Maybe infuse the rum first? No idea about proportions, though.\n\nOr i could try to literally add coke in some form. Out of a bottle is probably too dilute, but maybe cola syrup? Or dissolve some cola-flavoured candy?\n\nI think it's likely i would also need some sharpness. I could add lime juice, Cuba Libre style.

I used to have an old kalat account (that has been long deleted) that I use to post ng previous juicy experiences ko. Decided na maging lurker na lang for most of the time, until this happened... The story I\'m about to share is quite an unexpected turn of event in my recent (supposed-to-be) good girl and "bagong-buhay" era.*\n\n*Lemme first start this with a not-so-juicy intro, as to provide a brief background leading to the exciting part.*\n\n*(Please bear with me as well kung may grammatical errors man or magulo ko magkwento)*\n\nDespite being an introvert, I have different and multiple circles of friends. In this event, it involves yung circle na nabuo during my highschool days. Growing up leading to being a corp slave, sila ung circle that fully witnessed the bad and the wild side of me. Sila ung kasama ko during my "hoe phase" and when I took a break from it, and its brief comeback and then its full stop a few years back. We\'ve lost touch for a few years and just recently met again, about a few months ago. During one of our catch-ups, napag-usapan kung ano ba daw ba plan ko since my special day is fast approaching. Eventually, we\'ve come up with this absurd idea na we would celebrate it by relieving ung wild days namin, and  just party our hearts out like we used to do when we were still in our rebellious years. I then applied for a week long break from work and booked an accommodation to a known province up north. I was also with my family during this trip. I booked a separate airbnb for my family, but just near enough sa lodge na tutuluyan ng barkada, so that I could be with them once the tour I had with my family is done. Sumunod lang ung barkada ko with us the day before my day para makaikot din sila and maka-unwind on their own while I was with my fam.\n\nFinally the day came. It was already the 3rd day of our family\'s vacation. I toured with my family in the morning, had lunch, blew a birthday cake and went to my barkada\'s accommodation in the afternoon and dun na din nagbihis. Yessss, may pa-change outfit!\n\nBecause it was around 3pm and too early to party, we went to eat and have a chillnuman first to "V-Lounge". Our group then is composed of 6 (3 girls and 3 boys). When it got dark, we then moved to "S-Superclub" where the party is know to be lit. And it was lit AF indeed! Mejo nakainom na din kami at this point, tipsy yes, but still with enough energy to enjoy the night and party. As we entered the place, one of my friends, which we will just name "J" pulled me to the corner for a few minutes and told me to just enjoy the night, that I don\'t have to worry paano kami makakauwi to our lodge after, to drink to my heart\'s content and just have fun and sila na bahala with the rest. In short, pwede ako mag-walwal! Woohoo!!! Happy birthday indeed!\n\nA few minutes after we entered the place, a group of 4 guys joined our crowd. It turned out that our other friend, "P", invited his cousin (who is now permanently staying in that city) and his cousin\'s friends to join us. One of these friends is this slim, tall (between 5\'8"-5\'10"), clean-looking, moreno, big-eyed guy which I would just call "A". Almost the total opposite (except the slim and clean-looking part, big-eyed) of my typical type. I didn\'t pay much attention to him then pero naki-chika-chika lang ng unti to make them feel welcomed. We just had this brief one on one talk kung ilang days na sila nagi-stay dun and kung san sila nag-ikot for the past few days. He was kinda snobbish din kasi kaya di na din ako gaano nakipag-kwentuhan.\n\nAfter a few more drinks, "J" came out of nowhere, holding a bottle of tequila and a birthday cake. There\'s a sparkling candle sticking to it with the number "38", displaying my age out in the open. My friends all knew that I didn\'t mind it at all, as I don\'t look like my age. I would always get this impression from others/strangers na I look 5-10 younger than my actual age. With my height, and being makulit and malikot din daw made it even less obvious. Little did I know that this tiny candle would be the reason for a juicer night.\n\nAs we were downing our unknown number of shots of tequila, "A" approached me again, pero this time naka-smile na sya. Since the music is loud, need nyo to speak real close in each other\'s face and ears para magkarinigan and magkaintindihan.\n\n(Non Verbatim)\n\nA: "*So, 38 ka na pala.*"\n\nMe: "*Yuppp!*"\n\nA: "*Nagulat ako…*"\n\nMe: "*Why?*"\n\nA: "*I thought you\'re just in your late 20s, like 28*"\n\nMe: "*hahaha! compliment naman yan noh hindi bola*?\n\nA: "*Oh yes! At hindi bola. And para kang pang bata, yung walang alam na kalokohan… except uminom. Hahaha!*"\n\nMe: "*hahaha! Thanks! Pero I do get that a lot.*"\n\nAnd I shared with him a few of the funny encounters I had with people related to their first impressions of me.\n\nMe: "*So, ikaw ba how old are you na?*"\n\nA: "*Make a guess*"\n\nMe: "*If I guess it right, may price ba ako?*"\n\nA: "*A kiss*", he said while raising both eyebrows playfully\n\nMe: "*San?*" , I asked with a smile\n\nA: "*Sa cheeks, unless ok lang sa\'yo sa lips*" , as he points his lips with his finger and leaning a little closer to my face\n\nMe: "*Naahh! Might get arrested for child abuse*", I jokingly said\n\nA: "*What? Why?! What\'s your guess ba?*"\n\nMe: "*Same. Mga between 27-29.*"\n\nThis was an honest assessment. Despite his tall figure, he indeed looks young.\n\nA: "*I\'m 39!*"\n\nMe: "*Weh! Di nga?! Legit?!*", I said with an obvious surprise on my face\n\nA: "*hahaha! Yes!*", he proudly say\n\nMe: "*Gagi! Seryoso?!*"\n\nHe then took his wallet out behind his back pocket, pulled out his driver\'s licence and showed me his birth date that indeed showed that he\'s already 39.\n\nMe: "*hahaha! high five to the young-looking Tito and Tita!*" as I raised my hand to give him a high-five\n\nA: "*Nope! I prefer the kiss!*", he said as he put my hand down\n\nMe: "*Uy gagi! I don\'t want any trouble. Baka magalit gf mo*"\n\nA: "*Wala ngang magagalit eh*"\n\n(This was later confirmed true by his friends na he\'s single for quite a while now)\n\nI looked at him directly just to see if he was joking. Being the tease that I am when tipsy, and confirming that he was indeed serious, I got closer to his face, covered my lips with the back of my left hand, and pointed my right cheek for him to kiss. He laughed out loud. With a playful smirk on his face, he then faced me, leaned forward and left a gentle kiss on my right and left cheek. Our eyes met again as he straightened up and just both laughed out loud. Later that night, I found out na kaya pala sya mejo snobbish nung una is because akala nya masyado ako bata and malayo gap ng age namin. He then never left my side and we talked almost the whole time we stayed in that club.\n\n“*Body shot na!*”, shouted “J” while holding, I think, would be our 3rd bottle of tequila. We’ve also had a couple of cocktails on the side, so most of us at this point are pretty near our alcohol limits.\n\nAs it was “A”’s turn to do the body shot, he was then asked kanino nya gagawin ung body shot. Yep, he chose moi. He then got the salt shaker, a slice of lemon and the tequila shot from the table and walked towards my direction. All eyes were on us with a bit of kantyawan since everyone’s been noticing that “A” and I are getting extra close na. Kami lang halos ung madalas magka-usap the whole night, despite the place being jam-packed, as it was a Friday night.\n\nHe handed me the lemon and the tequila shot, just for me to hold it for him. Him, still holding the salt shaker, stood behind me, moved my hair covering my left shoulder and neck and  licked me there (just behind my left ear). He poured a little amount of salt on the same spot and then proceeded to lick, or should I say suck the salt out, but this time he did it slower. As his lips grazed the back of my neck, I felt the warmth of his breath that sent shivers down my spine.. and down there (iykyk). “*Fuck, that felt so good*” is what I could only think off that time. He got me by my weak spot with one shot. He then drank a shot of tequila, and sucked the lemon slice habang nakatingin sa akin.\n\nIt was then my turn, and of course, I chose him. Being the palaban that I am, I wanted to get that “revenge”. I slowly approached him and got him to hold the shot and the lemon for me while I held the salt shaker by my left hand. Using my right index finger, I slowly lifted his shirt by the hem, and grazed my finger lighty to his skin while doing so. As I continuously lifted his shirt up, it revealed to us his sculpted abs. Feeling ko hindi lang ako ung na-amaze nung nakita un. It was obvious that he has a good physique but we didn\'t expect to see such abs. Nowadays kasi mas madami na ung dad-bod. Everyone initially thought that I’d do the shot on his abs, but after a few seconds of pause, I continuously raised his shirt up, up to his chest. I saw his wide smile turn from excitement to surprise. Surprise, siguro nga dahil akala nya inosente ung kaharap nya and predictable. I then spread a little salt on his chest, just about an inch or two from his right nipple. As I licked and sucked the salt out from his chest, I remained in my eye contact with him. He then released a deep sigh as I intentionally grazed his right nipple with my lower lip. I raised my tequila shot and said "*Cheers*" at him while biting and sucking the lemon slice.\n\nWe immediately had another round. As it eventually became our turn, he chose me again and I did the same.\n\nAs it was his turn again, he leaned closer to my face and paused for a few seconds. I thought he would just be doing a simple body shot either on my cheek or jaw line or again on my neck, but I was wrong… Using his index finger, he traced the part where my camisole and skirt meet, sa bandang tummy area.\n\nJust to give a better picture, I was wearing a flowy-satin camisole in spaghetti strap as my top. Tucked in on a high-waisted A-line short skirt.\n\nHe then held a part of the camisole using his index finger and thumb and tugged it down exposing my cleavage, pero just enough not to see the bra inside. Nagulat ako and didn\'t expect na hihilahin nya ng ganun ung damit ko. He leaned down further and licked the part in-between my breast, sprinkled a little salt then proceeded after in slowly sucking all the salt out, much slower that how he had done it on my neck. Ramdam na ramdam ko ung light touches ng lips nya to my chest area. And naisip ko na lang is this guy really knows what he\'s doing.\n\n"*Ang bango mo talaga*", he whispered to me, then bit and suck the lemon slice that he placed on my lips earlier (before this he asked me to hold it for him with my lips, biting it from one end) And of course, hiyawan at kantyawan ulit after. We\'ve all agreed that it was indeed a bold move... and hot, If I may add.\n\nAnd since my friends fully know me na palaban nga, one of them said, "*Lagot ka, "A"! You\'ve awakened a sleeping beast inside*"\n\nAs it was my turn again as well, I had him bite the back of the lemon slice (he was holding it by his teeth, from the skin). Dito pa lang I heard one of his friends say "*Oh shit man! Mukhang nagising mo nga!*" I then placed my right hand on his chest and slid it down slowly up to his tummy. I\'ve raised his shirt again by the hem just enough to expose his abs. I have then asked him to hold it for me so I can use both my hands. As I started unbuckling his belt. I saw kung paano nanlaki ung mata nya because of this unexpected move. The rest of our group were cheering for me. I\'ve also noticed a few people from the other table watching us with smiles and curious eyes. I\'ve hooked the waist area of his pants and boxers with my left index finger and tugged it down, to expose more of his sexy V-line. Spread the salt a little to the V-line and just below his navel. Because of our height difference, it was effortless for me to reach, lick and suck that part of his body. Didn\'t break eye contact with him as well as I did that. I\'ve also left a featherlike kiss on his abs area and saw it twitch a little when my lips touched his skin. I then got the lemon from his lips with my teeth. Careful as not to touch his lips with mine, as I am well aware that he\'s expecting na i\'ll kiss him on the lips while doing so.\n\nAfter that round, nagpaalam ako with my group that I\'ll go to the restroom and freshen up a bit. Hindi ko na din alam at that point if ung init ba na nafi-feel ko in my body is because of the alcohol in my system or dahil dun sa mga tingin nya. And it was also almost the end of the night for us kasi sobra dami na namin nainom. I also had another event to go to the next day.\n\nAs I exited the restroom, I saw "A"  standing nearby, hands in both pockets and with a serious look on his face. Naisip ko baka may inaantay syang kasama from his group. I approached and smiled at him and tatanungin ko sana kung sino inaantay nya but then he just suddenly grabbed my hand and heard him say "*Follow me...*" I followed him without having any idea where we\'re going. Wala din ako choice since hindi nya ni-let go ung kamay ko. We then made a turn to the corner of the club na hindi kita ung crowd and walang tao. All I could see in that small corner is a wide but thin wooden partition that I think is used to hide some of the broken tables. I saw a few chairs as well. Wala din sya actually CCTV and walang naglalakad na tao around. As we reached the area with the partition, he suddenly grabbed me by the waist with his right arm then pinned me against the wall and pressed his whole body onto mine. As his left hand started caressing my right cheek, he looked me in the eye with a serious face and said "*Pwede na ba kitang i-kiss ngayon… sa lips?*" Mejo nag-hang ako dun for a few seconds. And once I realised what was about to happen, I gave him a smile and nodded.\n\nHe started with light kisses, as if gauging how my lips would react to his. And since mejo matangkad sya, I had to wrap my arms around his neck so I could easily reach and kiss him properly. Then it escalated quickly from slow, deep kisses to french kissing as we finally found our rhythm. It was like an explosion of the sexual tension that had been building up between us the whole night. Shit ang sheereepp nya humalik! Out of all the momol I had and lips I have kissed, sya ung pinakamasarap humalik. No cap!!\n\nAs his body is still pressed onto mine, I\'ve felt his growing bulge on my tummy. His hand has started to explore my body as well. His hands cupped my left breast and the right after, squeezing them lightly. I can\'t even move at this point and all I could do is moan on his mouth as he does all this.\n\nHis left hand then switched to holding the back of my neck as his right hand started slowly going down from my breast, to my tummy, to my waist and down to my thigh. He then placed one of his legs in between mine. Then lifted my left leg a little, up to his hips, pulled me in closer to him, as he intentionally positioned himself na yung right thigh nya is nakadikit na sa groin area ko. I know na at this point, he can already feel the warmth and the wetness that is building up down there.\n\nWith one of my hands still around his neck, I\'ve used the other to rub his erection from outside of his pants. I heard a moan and a grunt escaped his lips in between kisses as I continued to rub him. He then slid my skirt further up my thigh and felt his warm hand on my butt cheek. He squeezed it with much gigil. We both laughed a little as I jokingly slapped his chest and sinabihan ko sya ng "*baka malamog yang pwet ko.*"\n\n"*Shit, ang lambot kasi*", he said as he continuously squeezed it.\n\nHe then held both my arms and directed me to hold on to him tightly, to wrap my arms around his neck. He cupped my butt with one hand and wrapped his other arm to my waist as he lifted me up and effortlessly carried me. He sat down on one of the chairs and he sat me down on his lap, still facing him. The chair had a back rest pero walang armrest kaya mas nakagalaw kami.\n\nHe started kissing and licking me from the shoulder, since mas pantay na kami nito. His kisses went up to my neck and gently nibbled a part of my ear. Napapasabunot ako ng unti sa buhok nya since neck kisses talaga is one of my weaknesses.\n\n"*Walang hickey sa neck please*", I told him in between moans, and felt him nod as he continuously focused his kisses on my neck.\n\n"*Pwede ba?*" he then asked, hooking his finger on the strap of my top. I placed my hand on his and hinatak ko slowly pababa. Napangiti na lang sya and bit his lip, showing his excitement nung makita nya ung strapless bra inside, which is now the only piece of clothing left covering my breast.\n\n"*Pwede mo din yan tanggalin*", I whispered to his ear as I left a few kisses on his neck.\n\nI\'m not exactly sure how he did it. All I could remember is naramdaman ko na lang ung hagod ng tongue nya on my right nipple while his right hand gropes the left. He then teasingly licked and kissed \'em after without touching the nipple while still groping them one at a time. He kept doing this as he looked me in the eye, watching my reaction. Pero sya din ung hindi yata nakatiis and started sucking on them after a while. Napapaliyad na din ako as he does this as I hold onto him.\n\nSince it\'s been a while that I have this kind of "action" (by choice and that\'s for another story) it felt like nago-overload ung senses ko with all the sensation. It became more evident when he slid his hands inside my skirt.\n\n"*Damn, basang-basa ka na*", he whispered with gigil as he started rubbing my clit outside my panty. He asked kung pwede ipasok ung finger nya inside my panty but I refused, which he respected naman. I was also rubbing him outside his pants during this time. It was clear to him na walang penetration na mangyayari.\n\n"*Fuck, tigas na tigas na ko sa\'yo kanina pa*", I heard him say. Which had been already obvious earlier that night pa.\n\n"*Pull down your pants*", I told him. "*but keep your boxers on*"\n\nA smile escaped his lips as we stood up. I helped him unbuckle his belt and pulled down his pants down to his knees. As I pulled down his pants, I saw the mark of his precum sa boxers nya. I pushed him a little for him to sit down again. As I sit again on his lap, I raised my skirt a bit higher, enough for him to see kung paano ko tinapat ung pussy area ko on his hard-on which made him moan and cursed "*Tanginaaa*!" If my panty and his boxers were not in the way, we both know his dick would easily slide inside my pussy sa sobrang tigas nya and how wet I was. He held me by my hips as I held on to his shoulders, to get my bearing.\n\nI started grinding on him slowly as he sucked on my nipples and with his thumb rubbing my clit outside my panty. Despite the loud music playing inside the club, we could still hear each other\'s moans. Since I have auralism, nakadagdag sa horniness ko yung moans nya. "*Tangina, ang sarap mo!*", he moaned then kissed me harder which I reciprocated with the same intensity.\n\nHayyyy, sarap talaga nya humalik! Until now, as I write this, naaalala ko pa din how his lips taste like.\n\nAs I grind on his dick faster,  he then wrapped his arms around me. One arm around my waist, while the other around my back, with his hand holding on my shoulder to press me down on him further, kaya lalong ramdam na ramdam ko ung erection nya on my pussy. I could also feel ung controlled thrust nya. Sobrang sarap how his dick rubs on my clit. Lalo pa nakadagdag yung how wet we are. I could feel my juices spread on my inner thigh.\n\nIn between moans, we had this conversation.\n\n(Non verbatim)\n\nA: "*Shit, sige pa…*"\n\nMe: "*Ganito ba gusto mo?*", as I switched in grinding on him slow and then fast then slow again\n\nA: "*Yes! Tangina! Ah! Ang sarap mo siguro i-fuck*"\n\nMe: "*Gusto mo na ba?*"\n\nA: "*Oo! Kanina ko pa gusto ipasok titi ko sa\'yo*"\n\nMe: "*We\'ll see kung mapapasok mo*"\n\nWe\'re at it for a while at di ko na matandaan ung iba since in the moment kami parehas.\n\nA: "*Fuckkk! Lalabasan na ko! Ugh!*"\n\nI grind on him faster and faster as I hear those words. As he buried his face in between my exposed breast, I heard him grunt and then felt his whole body twitch as he orgasmed.\n\nNatawa kami pareho when he looked up a few minutes after na mukhang high ung expression nya. Obvious din ung cum sa boxers nya and asked him paano gagawin nya dun. He said na may spare naman sya in his car and would just change later.\n\nHis arms are still wrapped around me while we are having this conversation.\n\nA: "*Nilabasan ka na ba?*"\n\nMe: "*Hindi pa*"\n\nA: "*Hard pa din ako…* "\n\nHe then started rubbing my clit again with his thumb as he started licking and kissing my neck down to my still exposed nipples.\n\nPero potanginnnnaaaaaa! This is when his phone started ringing non-stop! We tried ignoring it a few times pero it just kept ringing until sinagot namin. It was "J" pala calling. All I heard was "J" asking where he was and if I\'m with him or if he\'d seen me around. I left my phone with one of our friends kasi before going to the restroom, since baka ma-misplace ko dahil nga I was kinda drunk na. Well mejo nawala na sya while I was with "A".  Nag-aya na din sila umuwi since one from my group and his\' were already wasted AF.\n\nWe were still kissing when we hung-up the phone. I saw his genuine, concerned look since di pa nga ako nagka-cum. I insisted na din na we should go. He asked me a few more times, while his arms were still around me. (Clingy yan?!) I told him honestly naman na bitin but it was still fine by me. He left a few kisses on my face before we stood up and fixed ourselves. He then went to the parking area to change his boxers as I did a quick run to the restroom to clean up myself. Magkasunod lang kami halos na nakabalik to our table to rejoin our group. We were given a few elbow nudges and another kantyawan. We didn\'t notice how long kami nawala which is matagal pala sabi ng mga kasama namin.\n\nHe also volunteered to drive us back to our lodge. We didn\'t bring any of our cars to the bar since we planned nga na mag-inom ng madami. He stayed with us at our lodge for a few more minutes before driving back to their own accommodation. He even snuck another kiss, which caught me by surprise, before greeting me a happy birthday and saying his goodbye. Nag-inuman pa din ung group namin sa lodge after, since may natira pa kaming bottle of vodka.\n\nI thought this would be my first and last encounter with "A", but a few days later, I was proven wrong…', 't2_w0q5hnyn', 'salt, tequila and lemon', 't3_14ulhfc', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/14ulhfc/salt_tequila_and_lemon/'), ('14tc4k4', '2023-07-07 11:31:15', 'DiscoElysium', 't5_h1vbu', '', 't2_vnw2egfx', 'I cosplayed Tequila Sunset', 't3_14tc4k4', 'https://www.reddit.com/gallery/14tc4k4'), ('14t1ljn', '2023-07-07 03:58:41', 'Gunners', 't5_2qhqt', '', 't2_s435g0k4', "TNT Don't think we will be having rice today Likely I'll have some tequila though", 't3_14t1ljn', 'https://twitter.com/Teamnewsandtix/status/1677235581062111233?t=V8LyHmctCF-OEy5ge6gHPQ&amp;s=19'), ('14ppkuw', '2023-07-03 12:38:52', 'KUWTKsnark', 't5_5mhcrd', '818 tequila time…I hope they all have a bad hangover!', 't2_2gkpo31o', 'Kendall getting ready for Hamptons Partying…shameless promoting her tequila', 't3_14ppkuw', 'https://www.reddit.com/gallery/14ppkuw'), ('14qoo52', '2023-07-04 14:34:30', 'tequila', 't5_2ri8c', '', 't2_3yicma96', 'What are your top five (5) favorite tequilas, if cost is no issue?', 't3_14qoo52', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/tequila/comments/14qoo52/what_are_your_top_five_5_favorite_tequilas_if/'), ('14vmrkm', '2023-07-10 02:18:27', 'rance', 't5_2um6i', '', 't2_1ent26lo', 'Tequila, Heineken…', 't3_14vmrkm', 'https://v.redd.it/wxnf0awb83bb1'), ('14vbplq', '2023-07-09 17:21:11', 'TequilaGW', 't5_4rqryu', '', 't2_bfugtecz', 'I don’t have a pool - but I do have a shower!

It was an exciting opportunity for me to explore their facilities and indulge in a private tasting. The distillery has now opened its cantina, "Don Tomas," to the public, creating a welcoming space where visitors can enjoy their Tequilas.\n\nDuring the tour, I had the chance to explore their warehouses, where the Tequilas age gracefully. The air was filled with the aromas that heightened my anticipation for the remarkable spirits waiting inside. Additionally, I had the pleasure of browsing through their thoughtfully curated store, where they offer exclusive and limited-edition Tequila 8 bottles for purchase. It was a treasure trove for Tequila enthusiasts like myself to enance my personal collection.\n\nFor those interested, Tequila 8 now offers distillery tours and tastings, which can be reserved through their official website, **https://www.tequilaochomexico.com/**(https://www.tequilaochomexico.com/). It\'s a fantastic opportunity to witness the craftsmanship and passion that goes into their Tequilas firsthand. While I didn\'t get a chance to try their upcoming restaurant during my visit, I\'m sure it will be a wonderful addition to the overall experience.\n\nMy visit to the new Tequila 8 distillery  deepened my appreciation for the artistry and dedication behind crafting exceptional Tequilas. If you ever find yourself in Arandas, Jalisco, I highly recommend making a reservation to explore their distillery, enjoy a tasting, and perhaps find a unique gem to add to your Tequila collection.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/18gsvaapzzab1.jpg?width=2544&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b9938a0cfee7bd9dbc05cced2c77e29917a45dad\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0mb9fkapzzab1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c9f1ef59235143d0b4cd3ba00b18d37b0cb075fb\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/83pv5bqvyzab1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=701be3d16828267700abac8d57957ccf125cfd47\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/977sywpvyzab1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f4be38b3082a368b434eea62ceb7de32b19428fa\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bwgmnxpvyzab1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=51de25cfb9badd0843c1ecc10433605b510aff71\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2x0g78qvyzab1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ba23a1ee88f36cb7216b26f8c7036fd758c42ed8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iwf687qvyzab1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5cbf02bb3633cc15cc263d9ab6976998401b4d2a', 't2_7d6h2m5e', 'A visit to the new Tequila 8 distillery', 't3_14v886q', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/tequila/comments/14v886q/a_visit_to_the_new_tequila_8_distillery/'), ('14t4fle', '2023-07-07 06:21:15', 'AussieTikTokSnark', 't5_7e2vmb', 'What in the TikTok lesbian crap is going on there?

Since I had quit drinking in March, I’ve felt like absolute shit. I felt depressed and sluggish and foggy, and didn’t experience the pink cloud everyone talks about after they quit. Then I started having really bad memory issues. I would get home from an outing and completely forget where I had just returned from, conversations with people were completely forgotten, and I was struggling to just make it through the day so I could pass out and sleep. Then, I became suicidal so I talked to my psychiatrist about antidepressants and she prescribed me Zoloft, which had no effect. \n\nMy blood work came back this week and I was diagnosed with folate deficiency syndrome, a type of anemia related to folic acid, and was completely depleted of Vitamin D2. This is prevalent in pregnant women, the elderly in early stages of dementia, and alcoholics. The doctor explained that heavy, consistent intake of alcohol blocked folic acid receptors and kept the body from absorbing the necessary nutrients. This can lead to lethargy, forgetfulness, weakness in your muscles, etc. and, in very rare cases, can cause hearing loss. \n\nI had started going Deaf two years ago, and a cause was never determined. My heart plummeted. \n\nI was prescribed heavy doses of both Vitamin D2 and folic acid and within 2 days felt immensely better. I had more energy, the mental fog was gone, and my depression started lifting. \n\nI was so sure I had avoided any consequences of my drinking because I wasn’t exhibiting symptoms of cirrhosis or anything, but I had indeed done some damage. Fortunately it’s reversible at this stage, and I’ll be doing blood work every three months for the next year until my levels are stable again. However, I will not get my hearing back. I have a MRI scheduled for next week to see if there is physical damage to my auditory nerves or frontal lobe. \n\nI guess my point is that alcohol can damage us in so many ways, ways we don’t even consider. Alcohol is a poison and it destroys us from the inside out. This is why I will not drink, and IWNDWYT!\n\nEdit: wow I didn’t expect so many people to respond to this! There were a lot of questions I wasn’t able to answer in the moment so here’s a brief rundown of the most common questions asked\n\nDaily intake: two bottles of wine and two or three cocktails (by ounce, about 85 standard drinks a week)\n\nThe bloodwork wasn’t just for liver and kidney function, I asked them to check everything since I hadn’t seen my doctor for a check up in ages\n\nI noticed my hearing starting to change about two and a half years ago and saw my PCP for a hearing test, but they said it was normal. I repeated this three times before they sent me to an audiologist who conducted several more tests, and through a bone conductance test and speech recognition test identified the source of the hearing loss. I started using hearing aids last August \n\nThe depression and suicidal thoughts were initially believed to be related to my bipolar disorder, which is why it took a bit between quitting and getting blood work done to figure out that it was likely nutrient related rather than chemically related\n\nThey’ve started me on 50,000 units of vitamin D2 and folic acid (not sure of dosage) for 90 days \n\nThank you all for your support and encouragement in your comments!

In my last marriage I had three step kids but only every other weekend so I could “hide it”.   I certainly did not wake up on time most weekends though.   Fast forward to now, one of the reasons something “clicked” in my head was getting the news that I needed to take custody of my niece.  Full time.  By myself.  She got a hold of her parents methodone treatment thinking it was a regular bottle of water and nearly died at 8 years old.  This ball got rolling around the same time that I was realizing I had a problem, but every time I tried to stop for a day, I would detox the next. I was in that vicious cycle of day ones trying to get to day 4.  But I couldn’t stay in bed all day weekends with her around.  I couldn’t sleep in when she had to go to school.  I couldn’t let her cycle of disappointment and foster homes continue.  I had to relearn how to handle stress without alcohol again.  And I had to learn to believe on myself again.

I didn’t get to sleep till 4:30am reading your comments and it was worth it! I remember my first sober days reading the daily check in and now I’m hosting! Such an honor! \n\nSo I want to talk about why I decided to stop drinking. I’m a 41 years old male and it took a DUI, countless embarrassing drunk behaviors, and a 48 hours bender last Summer to finally DECIDE TO STOP DRINKING FOR GOOD. (One day at a time 😊)\n\nI want to be clear that I have stopped drinking before. I had 11 months sober just before Covid and decided I could just have one drink. If you are like me then you know that one drink is never enough. Soon I was drinking a 12 pack a day, hungover everyday, irritable watching the clock at work till I could drink again. \n\nSo what is different this time around? I think it’s because I’m more mindful. I’m wiser. I know if I drink it will be worse and might kill me. I’m listening to sober podcasts (This Naked Mind, Recovery Elevator). I’m checking into /stopdrinking as often as I can. I’m hosting. I’m working out and playing golf (I love golf ⛳️). I’m saying no to situations that involve drinking. I’m not hanging out with certain groups anymore. I’m learning to live again. \n\nSo why did I stop drinking? I stopped because I wanted to be me. I can be me without drinking. I like the sober me. You will too! \n\nWhy did you decide to stop drinking?

Tried church, but this community is by far my #1 support system outside of my immediate family. I owe a debt of gratitude to everyone here.

I lied for almost 30 years.  The last 18 months since I admitted my alcohol usage was a problem has been life changing.   \nMany medications say avoid alcohol with usage.  Some say alcohol intensifies the effect.  In my 20’s I was on antianxiety meds, in my 30’s ADHD meds… drinking didn’t SEEM to be an issue.  I got away with it for so long that I felt I was impervious to this caution, that was for pharmacy Cover Your Ass only.  I’m pushing 50 now, and have been on a variety of heart and cholesterol meds along with mental health.  It took one new prescription for my body to flip.  2 10% drinks would get me smashed, and if I missed a day, I started to detox.  It took me months to figure this out, mostly because when I researched my symptoms on the internet, the results came up with alcohol withdrawal.  That couldn’t possibly be me, I wasn’t an alcoholic.  It HAD to be something else.  I was convinced that the cold sweats were perimenopause, so my gynecologist put me on hormones.  Didn’t help.  Went to the ER after 24 hours of sweating, yet shivering uncontrollably.  After 4 hours of scans and labs, I was discharged for “nothing wrong” with me!   Looking back, alcohol is absolutely the reason. The warnings on medications are REAL and they are there for a reason.   Saying you are on a medication and can’t drink is an absolute fact.  Do not feel like it’s a cop out.  \nNow for the YAY medical story…  before I got sober, I developed tachycardia issues.  Dr. put me on a beta-blocker.  It did NOT get rid of the problem fully, I still triggered the watch at least twice a month.  It dawned on me in March that I have not gotten the high heart notification in quite a while… checked the phone log and sure enough, I have not had one since July 2022.   Still true to this day.   \n", 't2_y3xckt8', 'The Daily Check-In for Wednesday, July 5th: Just for today, I am NOT drinking!', 't3_14r3x7u', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/14r3x7u/the_daily_checkin_for_wednesday_july_5th_just_for/'), ('14v7y5z', '2023-07-09 14:53:22', 'CrappyDesign', 't5_2sa3m', '', 't2_oj81hoq3', "I'm so confused by this drinking glass...", 't3_14v7y5z', 'https://i.redd.it/orlnitn5vzab1.jpg'), ('14q89cr', '2023-07-04 02:34:23', 'stopdrinking', 't5_2s7yr', '\\*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common.

I would wake up sluggish and announce to my (then) husband I didn’t want to drink anymore.  He’d say ok.  I’d abstain for a few days, maybe a week, then we would be back to the store to get more wine or Jack. He wouldn’t argue, wouldn’t remind me that I wanted to quit.  I was over 40, I was an adult, he supported my choice to not drink AND drink.   Three years ago my stepmom passed away, and I moved in with my Dad.

Worked for a company that made the containers, sold the containers, worked with marketing departments on the bottle designs too. Customers ranged from the homebrewers to microbrewerys to the global companies currently being boycotted for supporting transgender as of this writing.  From my first day at 23 years old, I was asked the question if I had an issue with alcohol because the bulk of our customers were in the alcoholic industry so if I had any ethical or moral issue, this was not a good fit.  I was a year out of college, of course I didn’t have a problem with alcohol!  In one day I went from a user to a contributor.  Drinking alcohol in my mind was supporting my customers and securing my employment.   Alcohol was recession proof.  I remember visiting our corporate office in Napa Valley, having dinner with one of our suppliers and having my first glass of wine.  “The Punisher.”  Little did I know how true this was.  Two bottles later I was driven to my hotel, got into my room and threw up. Managed to wake up on time and drive 40 minutes to visit another supplier, talking to my coworker on the phone, who scolded me for drinking red wine as my first wine ever… apparently I was supposed to start off with white.  ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)\\_/¯  \nI don’t remember much from that next day… except the meeting felt so surreal.  I thought the fact I was there in a suit holding a conversation meant I was successful.  I justified to my Little Sister (from Big Brother Big Sisters) that the alcoholic industry was a huge employer globally and it would destroy the economy outlawing it.  And sadly, that led to 15 more years of “successfully drinking”.  \n   \ntl;dr: The culture brainwashing is real.   And I was a part of it.   \nPS: made it through a 4 hour cookout today and only once needed to say “no thanks, I don’t drink.”    \n5 more days to go. 😁", 't2_y3xckt8', 'The Daily Check-In for Monday, July 3rd: Just for today, I am NOT drinking!', 't3_14pc2j9', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/14pc2j9/the_daily_checkin_for_monday_july_3rd_just_for/'), ('14qdxu5', '2023-07-04 07:30:38', 'Parenting', 't5_2qhn3', "My 9 yr old has been begging me every morning to have a cup of coffee.

When my husband and I were dating he wouldn’t drink as much as he was now. \n\nHe has stomach problems and still can’t seem to stop drinking. We live somewhere in Asia and the time difference with a lot of his friends in the US is a whole day. He was not working by the time we moved here. He occupied his days playing video games and eventually drinking. He would be drunk by the time I got home from work and just go to sleep, so I spent a lot of my time just by myself. I expressed that I didn’t want him to drink as much and he should get a job. He did. He’s doing great at his job. Today the 4th of July he has a dental surgery schedule for noon. He wakes up early at 6am to play video games with his friends which I get because the time difference. I wake up at 10am not because I want to because I can’t sleep with all the yelling. I go into his gaming room and I see 1L beer bottles on his desk and soju. I obviously get upset because nobody should be drunk at 10am. He tells his friends that he is playing with that something is wrong with me because I’m not drunk on the 4th of July. \n\nIt’s that time to go to his dental appointment and he says where are the keys. I say that he is not driving like that and he should get a taxi. It’s is not that far away from where we live. He argues then leaves. I expected this surgery to be 2 hours because that is what he told me. He comes back in 30 mins and is mad because he walked in the rain. Mind you he is still drinking after the surgery. Which the dentist says you shouldn’t do after surgery. He said it makes the pain go away. \n\nI leave because I had a orthodontist appointment. Which I’ve told him various times. He ordered dinner and I asked if he was going to eat with me. Which he said no he didn’t. Okay I ate alone did everything I needed to do. \n\nI got into the Fridge and the bottle of wine I bought 2 days ago is spilling all over the Fridge. I haven’t opened it myself so I already new my husband drank it. I took the bottle to his gaming room and ask him when he opened it. He replied this morning when “I still wanted to keep drinking and I it’s been there for 2 days”.I explode because he has done this various times, it’s like there can’t be anything with alcohol in the house because he will drink it. I’ve thrown away alcohol because of him. \n\nI tell him he needs to clean the mess and he mocks me saying oh there that took so long.I took a bath and I really thought If this is what I want my life to be.

The occasional coffee, a soda every now and again…nothing crazy. Now, onto the story.\n\nMy boyfriend and I were on our way to a show. It was hot and I was kinda tired, so instead of grabbing a Gatorade or something similar, I decided to get an iced coffee. I was completely unaware that this decision would drastically change the course of the day. I got a mocha cold brew…in a medium Big Gulp cup. \n\nI drank the whole thing on the way to the train station. I should have realized that this was NOT the play when I tasted it. It was so strong, it tasted borderline alcoholic. We got on the train, and this is when things started to go terribly awry. \n\nI never get motion sickness, especially not on the train, but almost immediately I started feeling nauseous and I was getting the spins while looking out the window. I still thought nothing of this and figured that there was a first time for everything. It’s about that time that I felt a gurgling in my gut and realized that this wasn’t your ordinary motion sickness, and something was terribly wrong. \n\nI managed to hold everything together until I got to Penn Station (in NYC). I had to find a bathroom…immediately. My boyfriend knows this, and the hunt for the bathroom was on. I’m barely keeping it together, and walking as fast as possible, which, at that time, was not too fast. If I walked any faster…it would’ve been a disaster. \n\nFinally we found a bathroom and I rush in. Dear reader, let me just tell you, without going into too graphic detail, what came out of me was complete liquid and required 2 courtesy flushes. I was drenched in sweat and shakey, but I thought that the worst was over. \n\nI was wrong. \n\nWe exited Penn Station, and almost immediately I felt dizzy. Like REALLY dizzy. Like about to faint dizzy. We were walking down the street and I had to sit down on the sidewalk so I didn’t drop where I stood. I thought that it was just from the heat. After all, it was in the high 90’s. Or maybe it was because I hadn’t eaten all day. \n\nMy amazing boyfriend ran across the street and got me a piece of pizza and a drink. At this point, I am a sweaty, dizzy, shakey mess sitting on the sidewalk. I try and eat, but it was almost as if my body forgot how to eat. I managed to get down a half a slice though. I had to stop. I was so nauseous that I was sure it was all going to come back up. Needless to say, I did not feel any better. \n\nIt took over an hour, and drinking 2 more waters before I felt capable of walking again. At this point we had to catch the train to Newark to get to the show. I COULD have just gone home at this point, but I’m stubborn, and was sure that I’d be fine. \n\nWe got to Newark okay, but as soon as we got off the train…right to the bathroom. At this point I’m convinced that I’m dying. I was still really shakey, so we decided to get something to eat so I could try and get more food in me. I got 2 mozzarella sticks in me before I got super nauseous again. \n\nWe get to the show, which was only about a 5 minute walk from where we got some food. As soon as we get in, bathroom…again. Now I was starting to get a screaming headache,but luckily we had Advil with us. Unluckily, it did not work at all. \n\nI made it through the show, and managed to shakily stumble back onto the trains to get home. A quick google search for “sick from 711 cold brew coffee” made me realize that I overdosed on caffeine. \n\nI drank that giant cold brew over 15 hours ago. It’s now nearly 5AM. I’m exhausted. My heart is still racing, and I’m still a shakey mess. Thankfully the trips to the bathroom have stopped. \n\nNever again, 7-11 cold brew. I learned that lesson. \n\nTL;DR: I drank a big 7-11 cold brew iced coffee and overdosed on caffeine.\n\nETA: This is *far from* my first run in with stimulants, if you get what I’m saying. (Edit - NOT overdosing…just partaking) Surprisingly, this was the worst though. This was just a terrible experience.\n\nETA (again): If anyone knows a way to counteract this that doesn’t involve medical intervention, please let me know. I need to sleep.\n\nETA (yet again): By medium Big Gulp, I mean the 30oz one (or .89 liters, for literally anyone outside of the US).\n\nUpdate: Still no sleep…21 hours after drinking that cold brew from hell. My awesome boyfriend is going to the store to get me Gatorade though. (I love him so much!) Still trying to eat without becoming nauseous (unsuccessfully), and still trying to get even just an hour of sleep. This suuuuucks\n\nUpdate 2: Still no sleep. It’s been 24 hours since I drank that devil juice. I managed to eat a banana (thank you for your suggestions!). I’ve been drinking water and Gatorade. Still really shaky and nauseous. Getting really worried that I got a contaminated batch (or possibly fermented, as someone suggested), and may have food poisoning (as many of you have suggested). Not happy at all\n\nUpdate 3: Some of you are actually scaring me a bit. I looked back into my Apple Watch heart rate data, and when I was resting, trying not to pass out yesterday, my heart rate was jumping between 48BPM and 140BPM over a 7 min time frame. I was sitting on the ground resting. Should I go to the hospital?! I’m actually really scared. Right now it’s going between 87BPM and 103BPM while resting (but I am mildly panicking!). What is happening?!\n\nUpdate 4: I’m not on my way to the hospital. A kind stranger talked me down…and so did my amazingly wonderful boyfriend, who’s been dealing with this shit right along with me for 2 days now. If I get worse instead of better, I will go to the hospital. Kind of just waiting for the crash now and hydrating. Thank you to you all for all your help and suggestions!\n\nUpdate 5 (Final update): I slept! For about an hour and a half, but still! I’m also able to eat a little bit, and am still hydrating. I’m gonna be okay guys! Thank you for all your kind words, your help, and suggestions. You guys actually helped me a lot. Hope you all never have to deal with this, ever! It’s no fun!

Some are truly able to rewire their brains and their relationship with alcohol which does allow them to indulge occasionally. \r  \n\r  \nI truly thought that was me, I was a month shy of celebrating 3 years alcohol-free when I made the decision to try my hand at having a few drinks. Life had settled down and improved in almost every aspect, I reached goals and milestones which allowed me to convince myself the drinking wasn’t to mend lingering traumas, it was a casual celebratory cocktail, one well-deserved. Oh, how very wrong I was regards to being able to have a healthy relationship, I have been on a month’s longer bender. I am not built for indulgence in any capacity, I don’t know how to just have one drink with dinner, or a glass of wine at happy hour. My main goal when I drink is to get drunk. \r  \n\r  \nI have never known true sobriety; from a youthful age I have used anything mind-altering to self-medicate. When I quit one addiction, I found myself controlled by another. This is what happened this past year, I tried to get off the bottle a few months ago by smoking pot, only to be constantly stoned and spending hundreds a month. \r  \n\r  \nFor the past 6 months I have been lying to myself and most shamefully, my husband, about the severity of the situation (falling off the wagon). He suspected, but travels for work often so it was much easier to hide. The shame and guilt were what kept me from being honest. I finally had a breakdown this past Sunday and came clean (slight double entendre) and it went better than expected, he is a saint, the most patient and understanding person I have ever met. \r  \n\r  \nHe asked me, “what prompted me to want to quit drinking 3 years ago” I have had a think and I don’t like who I am or what I do when I drink. I am Bipolar-I on meds which don’t work when I drink. I don’t feel like I live up to my potential, nor do I feel dependable or like I am present in my life and relationships. My inhibitions and cares are drastically lowered and it’s not fun anymore. Ten years ago (I am 38F), I would have the occasional bad night, now it is every single time I drink, my mind isn’t able to manage the effects alcohol creates. \r  \n\r  \nI’ve made peace with the knowledge I am an alcoholic/addict, and I always will be; I must be honest with myself that I will never be able to consume in moderation when it comes to any substances in my life at any time. There’s no shame in acknowledging and acting on this. \r  \n\r  \nSo, those of you who inquire about drinking moderately….we each have our answers to this, perhaps to find yours – ask yourself the same question my husband did me, “what prompted you to want to quit drinking?  \n\n\nHere's to Day #2 ....  \n\r  \nIWNDWYT\r  \n\r", 't2_5a1ffw6y', 'Drinking Moderately After Maintaining Sobriety - My Story', 't3_14qsk8k', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/14qsk8k/drinking_moderately_after_maintaining_sobriety_my/'), ('14p2m2a', '2023-07-02 18:28:28', 'CrusaderKings', 't5_2tgic', '', 't2_9uh80', "The guest of honor died on the way to my feast.

And I love drinking alone, I really don’t mind drinking with others but I always prefer being alone. I guess some would say it’s sad. But to me, it’s the only time I feel at peace. I feel normal, I feel safe. I feel happy. But I know it’s a problem. I know ever since I took my first sip it was going to be something I struggled with. I chose to drink anyway. I drink away the pain, I have PTSD from my childhood. I’ve been suicidal since I was 11. Alcohol helps it go away. But I know I am destroying myself. \n\nI’m joining this group and posting on here to share my story, but to also hopefully encourage myself to quit. It’s my drug of choice, the love of my life, alcohol. I wish I didn’t feel this way. It’s preventing me from a life I really really want. I’m worried it’s now encouraging my suicidal thoughts, my nihilism, my overall depression. I’m afraid to lose it though. I truly can’t imagine my life without it.
