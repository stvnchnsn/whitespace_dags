A month ago I quit weed, cigarettes and alcohol. I used to average a gram of weed everyday, 3-5 beers and a pack and a half of cigarettes(weekends sometimes 2). I was an anxious wreck and had heart palpitations and daily paranoia. Anxiety and OCD got a lot better, but still very much there. Still have panic attacks, but they are getting less.\n\n\n* I have OCD so I'm an all or nothing person which makes quitting and life very hard. I just want to live pure, without meds or substances\n\n\n* Withdrawals were and still are brutal. The first half of the day, I feel like pure shit. Maybe also because of quitting the coffee.\n\n\n* Massive brain fog, even more then when I was smoking. But anxiety is more tolerable at most times, and I'm sharper even tho my mind is soooo foggy. Hope this will improve soon\n\n\n* Reason I smoked is because I don't feel like I fit in everywhere, which makes me very angry and frustrated. I feel like people think I'm weird, which in turn ramps up my anxiety even more. There are pointers that my OCD is related to a mild form of autism\n\n\n* Other reason I smoked is because of loneliness and the feeling no girl wants me. I am not bad looking, but my insecurity and anxiety has ruined any chance at a relationship for me. Had some chances but was too afraid to go for them. I haven't had sex or a relationship in 10 years, which is causing a lot of self hate and sadness, and tears my confidence apart. The idea of a relationship feels unattainable to me, and it feels like I only ever deserve a relationship when I quit all substances, and even then I am not good enough. Seeing people effortlessly have dates and relationships, while I have to feeling I have to deserve it by quitting everything, makes me so sad and just fills me of self hate. \n\n\n* I am trying to do everything I am afraid off. Went on my first date in years and really liked the girl. Feeling wasn't mutual, so that really hurts like hell, but at least I'm not relapsing\n\n\n* I suffer from anhedonia, nothing brings me joy, even when I was smoking I wouldn't game/watch tv shows or anything. Just scrolling my phone. However, I'm going to the gym again and eating very healthily\n\n\n* I look a lot better, skin looks great again, black circles under my eyes are gone. Thanks to quitting smoking I guess\n\n\n* I always thought everything would be good again and my problems would dissapear by quitting and going to therapy, gym and so on. That I would finally feel what love is again, that I would be accepted by society and that I would fit in. Spoiler alert: it hasn't. Things still suck, I still have the same problems, but at least I'm not actively destroying myself anymore. I used smoking and  drinking as a selfmutilation technique. I used to smoke 5 cigs in a row, in 5 minutes time. I do everything rushed and as fast as possible, even eating or pleasurable things. I feel better, but still like shit a lot of the time, but at least I'm able to connect better with people and actively try to make things better instead of running away the whole time.\n\n\n\nCheers and on to month 2.", 't2_y72kw', "1 month clean of THC, nicotine and alcohol.

You see, I never found the inclination to try non-alcoholic beers. Too close to what kills me and I liken it to playing with fire. But mocktails... you see where this is going?\n\nI find myself sitting across from my wife of 10 years on an anniversary dinner in, of all places, Lexington VA. The young man (maybe 20 years old) serving us looked excited when I responded to his order for drinks with "lets try a mocktail! Would you please substitute the tequila in your spicy maragarita to seltzer water or ginger ale?"\n\nHe politely obliged and minutes later, I received my drink and took a sip.\n\nI knew something was wrong immediately. The taste was putrid and I had flashes of memories long put away. I asked the waiter "are you sure there\'s no alcohol in this mocktail?"\n\nHe assured me there was not, so I took another sip. Still, something was wrong and I knew it in my gut.\n\nI stopped drinking it, and a few minutes later the waiter ran back to my table (finally understanding the gravity of the situation), and grabs the drinks with near tears in his eyes.\n\n"I am SO SORRY, sir, the bartender misunderstood... there is alcohol in this!"\n\nAs I figured this was the case, I calmly responded, "thats ok, please take it."\n\nThe waiter came back twice to apologize. The bartender tried making me a real mocktail which I politely declined. The owner finally came over and put the dessert on the house.\n\nThe kid waiting on us still looked like he was on the verge of tears.\n\nI shook his hand and said, "thank you for letting me know, its OK, nothing is wrong here."\n\nMy wife was near tears as well for me, not knowing that I was perfectly OK with the accident. Long ago, I told myself this was an inevitability and that how I REACT is the only thing that matters. We cant expect to never encounter booze as we proceed with our sober lives. Its everywhere, and after 5 years of drop-less sobriety from alcohol, I mistakenly took two sips.\n\nDid I fall into a shame spiral and use it as an excuse to go wild? No.\n\nDid I panic and throw a temper tantrum because the world didn\'t exclusively cater to my sobriety? No.\n\nDo I count this as a reset to my 5 years of unblemished sobriety from alcohol? Hell No, not in the least. That would only occur when I have made the CHOICE to drink, not a mistake that can happen to anyone. \n\nDid I let it ruin our evening? Not for a moment.

So after people telling me to call in sick and my boss saying not happening i had about two hours before i needed to leave for work so i figured why not enjoy? Put on some music got on my carpet and closed my eyes. I had set an alarm to let me know when i had to get ready for work so yea almost missed that as i was compleeetely submerged in the carpet and music. \nNext problem was me realizing there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm driving so i figured I‚Äôll take the bus, as i got to the busstop i realized no way i am gonna do that, went home and got my bike which i then road to work.\n\nOn my way i made some mayor detours and eventually made it to work after the most beautiful, exhausting and rewarding bike ride of my life.

I had some amazing conversations and two guys even apologized to me that they were acting so weird, i had noticed nothing, pretty sure they were also tripping but idk didn‚Äôt ask. Gave me a super good feeling tho to know that there‚Äôs likeminded people here. All in all it was the most fun event I ever worked, my boss left after two hours so I was on my own which was super nice.\n\nI don‚Äôt exactly know how long i was bartending the wedding for but as i finished the stars were already out.

Anyways went home real quick grabbed some water, my sleeping bag and some weed and walked down to the beach (like 5‚Äò walk).\n\nI was up all night watching the stars and looking at the whitewash in the moonlight at some point my music had run out of battery but tbh it didnt bother me too much as the breaking waves played the most beautiful song i had ever heared.\n\nI watched the sunrise which was absolutely unreal I have never felt such a deep warmth come over my body and soul it felt like the sun was my tripbuddy saying do you understand now? Do you feel it? And i said i do understand. Well at least i understand more than i did before.\n\nEventually went home after a nice mornig walk on the beach and another good chat with a fisherman that lives next door. \n\nI thank you all for beeing there for me, even tho i wasnt replying/reading I think I felt all your good energy!

That beer is aged on oak chips, and I loved the oak flavor. It's not difficult finding oaked beers near me that are aged in barrels previously used for bourbon, whiskey, wines, etc. but these impart a good amount of flavor from those spirits, and what I'd really like to find are some beers that just use pure oak for the flavoring like that Ommegang beer did (whether it is aged in previously unused oak barrels, or oak chips, whatever.)\n\nCan y'all help me find some beers like that? I live in the Midwest USA near Kansas City, willing to buy locally or online. Not picky about beer style, though I'm less interested in sours in this particular instance. Would love to find something in a fairly casual price range ($10-25) that comes in a pack of bottles or cans.

Cheers everybody!\n\n\nAs you know probably know already, this week r/whiskey went offline by being set to private mode, or "going dark", as part of a coordinated protest conducted by a great many different subreddits, regarding some very unfortunate changes which Reddit recently made to how Third party applications interact with the website. Our own r/whiskey mod team statement published at the start of the event is here:\n\nwww.reddit.com/r/whiskey/comments/142gdlo/rwhiskey_will_go_dark_on_june_12th14th_in_protest/\n\nYou can read more about the start of the protest here:\n\nhttps://www.theverge.com/2023/6/5/23749188/reddit-subreddit-private-protest-api-changes-apollo-charges\n\nand then if you wish find the subsequent articles which that website has published on the same subject, one which they have been paying particularly close attention to.\n\nIf you want another POV, there is this article (which IMHO is well written and fairly presented as mainstream press coverage of complex subjects go) which also provides some background:\n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2023/06/12/tech/reddit-blackout/index.html\n\n---\n\nSo, the main purpose of this post is be an open forum for community feedback, an r/whiskey townhall meeting so to speak - albeit one more lubricated with alcohol than such things typically are in the real world. \n\nEvents developed too rapidly for our mod team to solicit your thinking about the June protest beforehand in a way that gave a wide variety of the users a chance to be heard, so the burden was thrust upon us (the moderators) whether we liked it or not (answer: we did **not** like it) to make decisions about whether and in what way to participate in the protest, without your feedback. I apologize for that, I wish it had been otherwise.\n\nBut now we want to hear from you. And preferably from as many of you as possible, including some subscribed to the sub who perhaps mostly lurk and do not post or comment - you are stakeholders too, and a group that we try to protect the interests of but without much guidance on what you are thinking, wanting, or needing from this sub.\n\nHowever, I would very much appreciate it if your commentary here in this post could address other subreddit governance issues too, and not just be regarding the June protest. That is one reason why I have not added a poll to this post - I do not want to channel your feedback by imposing a limited range of issues or options, instead I want it to be more free ranging than that. Also, polls are an open invitation to brigading or other forms of manipulation - we don\'t want that, and the risk of that happening would make a poll difficult for the mod team to correctly interpret its significance.\n\n\nSo, please comment with your views regarding this subreddit, how it is now, and what you want of it going forward. But regardless of which issues or stances you bring up, please in all cases add the following to your opening comment:\n\n- Pros - What has r/whiskey being doing recently that you want to preserve, which provides value for you?\n\n- Cons - What would you like to see changed in the sub, or what has been lacking in r/whiskey that you feel the absence of?\n\nIf you can\'t think of anything, that\'s fine. "No comment" is a valid answer. But please address both of those points (Pros, Cons) in some manner. And if you don\'t have any issue to comment on, but do have questions, then ask away and I will try my best to provide answers (but be patient, it may take a while). If you are feeling shy, "*What is your favorite whisky*" or "*What are you drinking tonight?*" are perennial classics that seldom fail to break the ice. But we really, really want to hear from as many of you as possible in some fashion.\n\n\nMy last request is: please be tolerant of answers given by other users which are different from yours. And please do not get into a tedious, extended debate with another user whose views invite criticism. This post is really for the mods to listen to what the community has to say, one individual at a time. Our task trying to make sense of it all will be made much more difficult if this turns into a debating contest. So, show respect for each person\'s turn at the proverbial microphone, you each get one. If you want to reply to each other fine, but keep it brief and respectful, and don\'t keep extending the commentary chain with one reply after another, after another.\n\nThanks and cheers everybody!', 't2_13kjp4', 'Riddle me this: how is a subreddit like a bottle of whiskey?', 't3_14bep4k', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/whiskey/comments/14bep4k/riddle_me_this_how_is_a_subreddit_like_a_bottle/'), ('14jf7xz', Timestamp('2023-06-26 06:52:16-0500', tz='America/Chicago'), 'milwaukee', 't5_2r7dt', 'I love whiskey and especially Buffalo Trace Kentucky Bourbon whiskey but because supply they make and demand across the US the Midwest is pretty limited.

We clean up and he thanks me.  \n\nI had such a hard on and needed a release....by this time people started to come in. I walked over to the single booths and found one with a large glory hole.  I was in there sitting for about 1 minute when a hand comes poking through the hole. I don't know the secret language, but I assumed whomever wanted to play with my cock.  My cock was still hard from my first experience from 20 minutes earlier. I'm completely smooth and shaved...I slide my cock and balls into the hole.  I felt the most wonderful warm mouth....stroking me. I didn't last long. I came a lot...I could feel whom ever drive my cock deep when I was cumming....they stayed there for about 5 seconds swallowing everything I had. I was spent.  \n\nOne question...I have always told my partner when I was cumming..just as courtesy...is there a way, signal wise to let whomever on the other side know?\n\nI will definetly be back.

My experience with whiskey is rather limited all things considered. I started this journey in about 2019 with my dad at the Baltimore Distillery who made Epoch and it's been an absolute blast since. \n\nRecently I moved to Washington State and the Woodinville distillery is nearby. I've had their stuff every now and then and quite enjoy their recent Sherry cask bottle. I saw a post here from a month ago mentioning a Maplewood smoked bottle, and it sounded very interesting so I was hoping they'd have that. Sadly they didn't (it was apparently gone within a day!). I did pick this cask strength rye up though!\n\nPrice: $69.95\n\nProof: 116.46\n\nNose:\nImmediately, I get a floral, kinda fruity sweet sense from it, which is not something I expected from a rye, let alone a cask strength. A bit of vanilla is present as well. \n\nPalate:\nA much more sweeter than expected rye palate. It leads with a strong caramel taste followed by a cherry, kinda raspberry almost fruity flavor.\n\nFinish:\nA long finish with that typical rye bite and tobacco flavor. The warm caramel flavor lingers the most. \n\nOverall:\n\n7.5/10 on the t8ke scale. \n\nI am a big rye whiskey fan. My favorite in particular is the Sagamore Rye 8 Year bottle (almost my favorite bottle even). This doesn't quite hit that level but it's very good. \n\nThis is my first review where I actively try to pinpoint the specific flavors, and I hope I did an okay job. It's quite difficult with the alcohol burn haha!

He has a wide range of interests, so there are quite a few routes I could go down.\n\nFirst off, he loves cooking and baking. He's pretty well equipped with basic appliances like an air fryer, coffee pot, stand mixer, rice cooker etc. So I'm hoping to find something unique that can add a touch of excitement to his culinary adventures.\n\nSecondly, he's also into carpentry. He's actually pretty good at it, but I'm not entirely sure what tools he already has, so any suggestions in this area would be very welcome.\n\nHe's a big fan of whiskey and bourbon, and while he doesn't own any 'fancy drinking equipment', it'd be great to find something that can enhance his enjoyment of these drinks. Is there such a thing?\n\nAnime and Japanese culture are two of his favorite things. I've bought him shirts in the past, so I'm trying to steer clear of that this time. \n\nHe's also into tech, but he seems to have all the essentials (cellphone, wireless earphones, gaming laptop, tablet), so I'm a bit stumped in that area. \n\nHe likes room decor like posters, but he'll be moving out soon, so I'm not sure if that's a good idea. \n\nOne more important thing to note is that he's leaving the United States soon, due to visa issues. So maybe there's a uniquely American gift that he might appreciate? \n\nI know this is quite a list, but I'm hoping to find something special that caters to his interests.

I just woke up &amp; am ready to make a change.)\n\nContext: I‚Äôve been on a sobriety journey since 2018. I‚Äôve done so well until recently. For about 3 months now I‚Äôve been relapsing on beer. But then, of course, just the beer turned into the occasional bottle of wine, and now I bought liquor. Vodka specifically, which is my personal demon.\n\nI can feel how much it‚Äôs a poison to my body, mind, &amp; spirit. It‚Äôs something I **know** in my bones that I have to reject. However, if I‚Äôm being vulnerably honest here, I cannot find the inner strength to dump the rest of the cheap bottle I got out into the drain. \n\nBest way to describe it is like the Angel &amp; devil on my shoulders are having a wrestling match, and I feel stuck in a frozen state of fear while they‚Äôre going at it. \n\nI‚Äôm not ashamed to admit I need help. I need encouragement. I need some positive motivation from you incredibly wise people here who can understand what I‚Äôm experiencing right now. I want to do better and I KNOW I can. I have before, and I‚Äôll do it again. I‚Äôm just very overwhelmed at the moment &amp; feel lost in my own thoughts. \n\nObviously dumping the vodka is only the first step. Then it‚Äôs about saying no to the beer &amp; wine &amp; attending meetings. But taking this vital first step of getting rid of the vile liquor is what my soul needs to feel empowered enough to do so.\n\nSo, once again, I‚Äôm humbly asking for your encouragement. Please help me find the inner strength to dump this garbage. I truly aspire to come back &amp; make a post here in the hopefully near future about how I managed to overcome my addiction again. I know for a fact that it‚Äôs possible. \n\nThank you *so* much in advance. I‚Äôve been lingering on this sub for weeks now &amp; just finally found the courage to make this post. I sincerely hope it‚Äôs not too triggering, but honesty is the best policy. And like my disclaimer stated; I am not currently under the influence &amp; need to make that clear.

The apartment I live in is a kind of suite-style layout, with three bedrooms with private bathrooms, and a shared kitchen and living room. I didn\'t know anyone living at this apartment complex, so the roommate roulette selected a roommate for me. My (21F) roommate is someone I\'ve known for quite sometime; we were in middle school and high school together, knew of each other, but we were never friends. We had had a single class together, had always been nice to each other, so when I had first moved in, I thought that I had gotten an ideal living situation. I thought that maybe we could be friends, and the typical drama of having roommate beef would be something I didn\'t have to deal with.\n\nI went through a sort of breakup about halfway into our living together. I\'ve handled it largely on my own, and in the course of my grief, my sister gifted me a mini vodka bottle. It was also a birthday present (another story). My roommate knew, and I joked about taking it as a shot, and she asked if she could join in. I said no, as there\'s only enough for one shot, and I was just going to keep it for a rainy day. Eventually, in my own personal deliberations, I decided I didn\'t ever want to drink it because I have a tendency to use things like drinking, weed, or casual sex to cope with difficult situations. I don\'t want drinking or any of those things to be my default when sh\\*t hits the fan, so I\'ve kept the bottle unopened in my bedroom.\n\n(A little context before I continue: I\'m currently out of town and will be out of the apartment for basically all of July. I\'m staying with my family about three hours away.)\n\nFast forward to yesterday. I get a text from my roommate asking if she could use my vodka for a cocktail. She said she didn\'t know where it was, and she was asking because she didn\'t have any and it would save her some trouble. I responded a minute later saying that I would prefer it if she didn\'t. She responded with an "okay!" and I thought that was that. This was at about one in the afternoon. I went to bed earlier tonight, woke up to a text message at around two AM from roommate saying that she had opened the bottle and broken the seal when she got my text message. She said that it was all still there, and that her mom couldn\'t find any replacement bottles anywhere in town, but she could get me three of a different brand, and she\'s really sorry.\n\nThere\'s quite a few things here that I take issue with. First of all, I responded a minute after she texted me. So, before I even had a chance to reply, she went into my bedroom, found the bottle, opened it, and then saw my text. Second of all, why was she in my bedroom at all without asking if it was okay for her to go in? I keep my room closed but not locked, but from this point onwards I probably will be. Third, if she didn\'t use any of it, why does she need to replace it three times over? Fourth, why send me the apology *12 hours later*?\n\nI don\'t really care about the vodka so much as her going into my bedroom, taking the bottle, and assuming I would be fine with it. And this is all part of a much larger issue, but it\'s already late here (about 4 AM), and I need to drive back in the morning. I haven\'t texted her back, and there\'s a few things I need to set straight, but I\'d rather talk about it in person. I\'m mainly posting this because I feel like I\'m being overdramatic, as I\'ve never had a roommate before now, and I don\'t know the typical etiquette in this situation. But, this isn\'t the first time where I\'ve felt like she\'s crossed the line, and I think if it continues like this, I need to figure out a different living situation. But that would be adding more trouble into the mix that I\'m not sure is worth it.\n\nThere\'s a lot more context here that I\'m leaving out because this post is already pretty long, and if I were to detail more issues I\'ve had, this post would double in length. But, I can add some more instances I\'ve taken issue with (and additional context!) if wanted. This is just one of many incidents. To finish this up, because I really *really* need to get to bed, I\'m mainly concerned about this because this living situation is stressing me out, and I don\'t even have a lot going on right now. I took one summer class, and I commuted on weekends to see my family out of town. I might have a job in the fall, I\'ll be taking almost 7 classes next semester, so I can\'t even imagine how much more stressful this situation will be in the future when all of those factors are put into the mix. Should I stay and make it work, or should I go and hope for the best?\n\nUPDATE: I got to the apartment, and told my roommate that after I get settled in my room, we needed to talk. About an hour later, we sat down, and the living room was a mess; there were wrappers all over the place, crumbs all over the armchair, articles of clothing flung here and there, you name it. She said she wasn\'t expecting me today and had been planning on cleaning up tonight. \n\nAnyways‚ÄîI opened with how I did not care too much about the vodka itself so much as her entering my bedroom without my permission and taking something that\'s not hers. She proceeded to say that *she felt uncomfortable doing it*, to which I replied, "You can imagine then, how uncomfortable *I* feel." I said she violated my trust and crossed a line. I pointed out a bulk of the things I said in this post; she said she didn\'t assume that I was going to say yes, but she went ahead and did it anyways. As for the late apology, she said that she\'s bad at confrontation, and she was working up the nerve to mention it. She also admitted that she needed help drafting the apology, and her mom helped. But first, she wanted to replace the bottle, and if she could replace it then "we could have just laughed it off in a few months from now" or something to that effect. But her mom couldn\'t find a replacement of the one I had. She said she didn\'t want to lose my trust and lose me as a friend, to which I made it crystal clear that we don\'t have the kind of trust and intimacy she thinks we do, and it\'ll be a long time until I trusted her again. She said that she would be better, and I told her that since she has betrayed my trust, I\'m going to have a hard time believing her. She said that she wouldn\'t trust her either, especially not now. Which, I don\'t know what the hell that\'s supposed to imply, but it certainly doesn\'t make me feel reassured. She said she was going through a hard time, but that\'s not an excuse to steal something of mine. I left the conversation for some breathing room between the two of us, and I\'m out of the apartment still. She texted me about two hours ago asking if it was okay for her to get two cats that had bonded to each other, which, if she\'s not in a good headspace right now, I don\'t know how much additional responsibility is going to help her. Make of that what you will.\n\nThroughout the conversation, she seemed more concerned about how this incident would affect our living relationship and my perception of her, not much remorse or guilt whatsoever. If she apologized, I didn\'t hear it. At the beginning of our conversation, I was hoping I\'d get a reasonable explanation, and I was leaning towards not moving at all. But after everything she said, I don\'t think this is reparable. I\'m going to read over my lease agreement tonight, and tomorrow morning I\'ll have a conversation with my leasing office about switching apartments. I don\'t know how many roommates she\'s gone through now, but I wish the best of luck to the next folks who take my place.', 't2_8o0bned1', 'Roommate (21F) took my vodka.

We\'re planning on serving Nemiroff and Zirkova Unity as Ukrainian examples (although, admittedly, the edition we have is the "Unity" edition which is technically Canadian, but the profits are supposed to go to Ukraine) and, naturally, we have no Russian (AKA Muscovite) vodkas in-store, and we won\'t be serving any.  I have several questions, and if I\'m wrong about anything, I\'d like to know so I can present it right.\n\n1) A co-worker of mine said the usual "Cheers!" or "To Health!" in Ukrainian is pronounced (what sounds like to my ears) "Dai Boi-zhe!"  A Ukrainian cookbook I borrowed from a local library is titled, "Budmo!" and on the inside, it mentions that "Budmo!" is an equivalent of "Cheers!"  Is only one or are both correct, and how are they roughly pronounced?\n\n2)  Related to question 1, is there a difference in context between either?\n\n3)  What are the snacks that go alongside vodka called in Ukrainian?  The Polish term, I\'ve learnt, is "ZakƒÖska", which sounds like "Pshah-kohn-ska" to my ears (the "oh" is a really nasalised "o" to my ears, like in the French word "on").  One way I\'ve seen it transliterated to Latin letters is "Zakusky".  Is it correct, and how is it properly pronounced?\n\n4)  What foods really go well as the appetisers to go with the vodka?  When I went to our local Ukrainian Co-op here in town, they recommended salo, dark rye bread, butter, pickled cucumber and mushrooms, borscht, smoked fish, varenyky, and sprats in oil.  A bartender I know also mentioned green onion dipped in a sauce.  Are there other recommendations, as well?\n\n5)  Related to the last question, if dipping green onions in sauce is a typical thing in Ukraine, what is in the sauce?\n\n6)  From what I\'ve been told, vodka is typically served neat (no ice) but chilled in Ukraine.  Should it be kept fridge-cold or freezer-cold before the event if it\'s supposed to be chilled?\n\n7)  Are there other Ukrainian customs around vodka that I should know and let people know, too?\n\nThank you for your time!\n\nSlava Ukraini!

How did it come to be?\n\nEDIT: This is an excerpt from the Wikipedia article about the cotton gin:\n\n‚ÄúThe invention of the cotton gin caused massive growth in the production of cotton in the United States, concentrated mostly in the South. Cotton production expanded from 750,000 bales in 1830 to 2.85 million bales in 1850. As a result, the region became even more dependent on plantations that used black slave labor, with plantation agriculture becoming the largest sector of its economy. While it took a single laborer about ten hours to separate a single pound of fiber from the seeds, a team of two or three slaves using a cotton gin could produce around fifty pounds of cotton in just one day. The number of slaves rose in concert with the increase in cotton production, increasing from around 700,000 in 1790 to around 3.2 million in 1850. The invention of the cotton gin led to increased demands for slave labor in the American South, reversing the economic decline that had occurred in the region during the late 18th century. The cotton gin thus "transformed cotton as a crop and the American South into the globe\'s first agricultural powerhouse".\n\nBecause of its inadvertent effect on American slavery, and on its ensuring that the South\'s economy developed in the direction of plantation-based agriculture (while encouraging the growth of the textile industry elsewhere, such as in the North), the invention of the cotton gin is frequently cited as one of the indirect causes of the American Civil War.‚Äù\n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\nEDIT2: Okay, guys.

I don\'t know if it\'s a good brand or a bad brand, but it was what was recommended to me and I like it well enough, just not well enough to consider it a sipping gin. The recipe I got it for was from a fish care podcast, which I made a few modifications to.\n\n"Dirty Flamingo" Original Recipe:\nA shot of gin poured over ice cubes of frozen grapefruit juice with bruised rosemary inside of them. Personal opinion - Decent. Positive four on a negative ten to ten scale.\n\nYes, it is essentially a fancy gin and juice. Shhh.\n\nMy modifications:\nA shot of grapefruit juice, a splash of lime juice, and a shake of orange bitters. Personal opinion - Something I will make again for myself on a hot summer\'s day and would actually offer others, but not my favorite. Positive 6 on a negative ten to ten scale.\n\nI don\'t drink a lot at you might tell. My favorite drinks are classics, Moscow Mules, Whiskey Sours, Old Fashioned. Love a good milk punch. What I know I like is largely whiskey-based, becuase I don\'t drink a lot and generally get A Bottle Of Something and go through it in a few months. The last bottle of something I got was whiskey, and until about 9 months ago I was in a relationship that prevented me from drinking much at all. So, other things I know about my prefferences: Love tequila straight, hate margaritas.

Well, my friend is. I\'ll have a contractor/consultant deal cause I want compensation whether or not it succeeds.

Instead of building an "all-in-one" ERP-like system, we plan to make modular, fast solutions that integrate with existing systems to make them less shitty. So we\'re thinking of small, independent REST services.** \n\nRight now, I\'m leaning on Go. I know, it has its flaws and gets a lot of hate these days. I agree with some of the criticism. But deployment is a breeze, I\'m already familiar with it, and despite the verbosity, wheel reinvention and endless if err != nils, it\'s pretty easy for me to understand what\'s going on in a Go codebase, in my experience. I like it. Also, the #1 issue with existing systems is in how slow they are. Go is pretty performant for a GC\'d language.\n\nI was considering ASP.NET Core as well, as this is what I\'m most experienced with, but this comment(https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/uepi26/what_are_the_upsides_and_downsides_of_go_compared/i6paxcx/?context=3) sums up what I hate about it, and I really don\'t want to deal with that again.\n\nJava (especially with Spring Boot) is nearly identical to C#/ASP.NET, so why am I considering it? Because  we don\'t know if we\'ll need additional devs, and Java devs are much easier to hire. We could probably just hire Java devs and teach them Go, but I\'ve read some horror stories where Java devs basically try to write Java in Go, which results in very messy codebases. And I\'ve read that the JVM can be optimized to be really fast if needed, even faster than Go. I\'m currently looking into alternatives to Spring Boot because I hate it, and Jooby seems nice. \n\nThe last one on the list is Python with FastAPI. Not an expert in these, but I used it for a bit in my last job and it was very easy to use. It\'s kind of like Flask but with Async features and type annotations. \n\n**Any tips on making a choice?** I\'m trying to put my preferences aside and evaluate my options more objectively, but it\'s very hard. I\'m really biased against the "batteries-included" type of frameworks, because despite the initial productivity speedup, there\'s always a point where I\'m forced to dig through docs for an entire day trying to fix a problem I would\'ve solved in minutes if I didn\'t have all these framework abstractions in my way.\n\nThanks.\n\n**TL;DR: Read the text in bold**', 't2_dwjuy2jam', "Help me choose a backend tech stack for a property management SaaS.

Here‚Äôs how I, a busy executive, cracked this puzzle. \n\nI‚Äôll sometimes have 5-6 flights in 7 days. I live in Singapore and have done Asia, Europe. Australia and USA like this.  2 weeks plus has been no problem, even with the winter in Wisconsin and the heat of Arizona out of the same bag on the same trip. \n\nI start with a repeatable checklist on the Google Keep app on my phone. It‚Äôs my master plan, honed over time, and it makes packing a breeze. I agree with the pack for 5 days concept. Sticking to 1 list is some great advice  as you can continually remove and adjust as you learn.\n\nMy wardrobe? Simple but formal and casual enough. A quarter-lined linen jacket (classy yet casual) is my mainstay, teamed with black 5-year tees from Lululemon and jeans or ABC Pants. It's the perfect mix of comfort and style for long days of meetings and longer flights. If it‚Äôs freezing a merino tee underneath keeps me warm enough. \n\nFor weather challenges I've got the versatile Patagonia Nano Puff and a Patagonia waterproof shell. This combo equips me for rain, wind, or snow. \n\nMy tech arsenal includes an AliExpress 65W USBC adapter, a pint-sized powerhouse that juices up everything from iPhones to MacBooks. \n\nFitness is non-negotiable for me, so running shoes and gear are always in my bag. \n\nHow do I manage laundry? A scrubber washing bag ( https://thescrubba.com/ ) , washing powder strips, and tried and proven hack: hanging a coat hanger on the hotel room's aircon outlet. Clean, dry workout gear is ready in just 4 hours. \n\nMy bags of choice:\n\n- Either the Peak Design Travel Bag \n- Samsonite roll-on.\n\nToiletries are sorted with Peak Design along with my packing cubes. \n\nMy essentials include:\n\n- Matador Dry Shampoo bag,\n- 1/3 block of a good coconut oil body soap (trust me, some hotel gels leave your skin drier than a Saharan cactus) https://matadorup.com/products/flatpak-soap-bar-case\n-  5ml refillable perfume sprayer I can put in my laptop bag for that midday freshen up between meetings.\n- a good moisturiser \n- electric shaver \n\nTech for travel: \n\nIt's back to MacBook despite trials with the iPad Pro. A lifesaver for flights is the Airfly Pro which lets me use my high-quality headphones inflight. https://www.twelvesouth.com/products/airfly \nGadget essentials include \n\n- 3 in 1 charger for MacBook to any device type, https://a.aliexpress.com/_mKToEJQ\n- Zendure passport III for other charging needs, https://powerbank.zendure.com/products/passport-iii-all-in-one-65w-adapter-for-home-travel\n- a mask plus foam earbuds for when I don‚Äôt want to use my noise-cancelling headphones.\n\nHealth necessities: \n\n- Zinc &amp; Vit D for immunity, \n- Melatonin for jetlag, and hydration managed with electrolyte drops. \n- The last one‚Äôs a gem: this 25ml bottle converts 10L of hotel-provided water into electrolyte-rich hydration. (https://eletewater.co.uk/products/elete-25ml-pocket-bottle)\n\nGym Gear tip: \n\nOpt for the thinnest, lightest fabrics. Wash immediately after using the scrubber bag. To dry, roll clothes in a towel Swiss Roll-style, then twist. \n\nShoes: \n\n- Soft, fold-flat leather work shoes, \n- Vivo Barefoot Primus sneakers for casual wear (https://www.vivobarefoot.com/rw/primus-asana-mens) and flights\n- Nike Track runners for indoor gym runs or Pegasus for serious outdoor running.\n\nOther tips: \n\n- Lululemon has won the clothing brand battle for me for the most part \n- Tripit Pro is 100% worth it \n- Pack your gadgets bag with everything you need for flights. Whip it out when on board to save fumbling around for headphones or whatever else. \n- Backpacks win but if you‚Äôre going to be seen with Investment bankers you need the Roll on and laptop case to look more professional and less like you just came from the beach \n- A 3m charging cable is often super handy. \n- Always BYO usbc to hdmi adaptor for meetings and presenting \n- Skip the breakfast buffet  and find a nice coffee at a coffee shop. The steps and fresh air are great. \n- Pack a hat and sunglasses last. They usually don‚Äôt get used and often I‚Äôll leave them behind.", 't2_4j36iv1k', 'Boardrooms, Gyms and Gins.

Men jeg er selv opdraget med, og fors√∏ger at efterleve, det princip om at vise hensyn og v√¶re lidt \'wholesome\' i hverdagen, simpelthen for at vi alle f√•r det lidt bedre.

So far based on my research I think I need 6 different bottles to have all the major categories covered and to be able to make pretty much any cocktail. Below are the categories and the bottles I am thinking of getting.\n\n* Light Rum - I\'m debating between **Plantation 3 Star**, **Real McCoy 3 Year**, or **Foursquare Probitas**.\n\n* Dark Rum - Debating between **Plantation OFTD**, **Lemon Hart 151**, or **Hamilton 86** (or 151). To be honest I\'m a bit confused about what constitutes a dark rum vs an aged rum. To me the dark rums, traditional ones at least, are aged, but just only for a few years and are more appropriate for mixing. Whereas "aged" rums are typically aged much longer and more appropriate for sipping. There\'s also "dark" or "black" rums that are simply just rum that has dark coloring added.\n\n* Aged Rum - Debating between **El Dorado 12**, **Doorly\'s 12**, or **Real McCoy 12**. As I indicated above I\'m thinking this would be my primary sipping rum. \n\n* Funky Jamaican Rum - Debating between **Smith &amp; Cross**, **Hamilton Pot Still Black**, or **Wray &amp; Nephew White**. The S&amp;C and Hamilton seem to be aged a bit, where the W&amp;N is unaged. Does it make sense to have both aged and unaged?\n\n* Rhum Agricole - The only respectable brand I have access to is **Rhum JM**, I can find the **White (40%)** and the **VSOP**.

You'll almost always have to be outside to obtain any actual good stuff, which I am fortunate to be able to do so, as I am an expat within the Middle East, where paradoxically, there is much better (though still limited) alcohol availability.\n\nIn terms of personal experience, the only rum I had other than Bacard√≠ and the Old Monk was Havana Club 3 (the proper Cuban one) which was my favorite so far (only in cocktails though, I'm not a sipper whatsoever). I've been eyeing this Appleton Estate Reserve Blend since I've been reading about rums, and I finally decided to get it. Converting to US Dollars, it was around $34 for a liter.\n\nI'm intrigued to know what are your thoughts! I'd love to know if it's a good choice, how I may perceive it as someone with very limited rum experience (and almost non-existent if thinking of good rum), as well as if I got ripped off (can and does happen with so many other categories of spirits) or if it's decent. What's interesting is that these sorts of things are not popular at all. Anything enthusiast oriented does not move. This means old stock will always stay, hence the 8 Reserve being unavailable, but if the old stuff is better (which I heard this is, due to increased funk), that's good.

Make it taste good.\n\nIn that order.\n\nI have attempted this before as a naive 21 year old who had only ever had rum in a rum and coke.

And I may have a small problem, maybe you guys can help me maintain it!\n\nSo the first good bottle I ever tried was surprisingly enough, Fortaleza Repo! I am an avid follower of lucas assis &amp; long-island lou tequila on instagram and had been watching some videos about a year or so back. I remember a few days later being in one of my local liquor stores and randomly seeing a bottle tucked away on the bottom shelf that read ‚ÄúFortaleza‚Äù. Something clicked in my brain and I remembered seeing it in a recent video, so I immediately grabbed it and checked out. From that night on, my life was forever changed, having been a fan of casamigos prior to that, to then sipping on fortaleza,my mind was immediately blown and I just knew everything i had thought was a lie! And the craziest thing is, that was the LAST bottle of Fortaleza that store ever got and probably will be for a long time, so they say. (Luckily I since found another guy who gets then often) \n\nFrom that bottle, you can see where my palette and curiosity has lead me, with a lot of help from TMM and Instagram, Ive discovered some amazing sippers. Some of my current favorites are the Ocho Repos, always creamy, buttery, caramely with hits of oak and agave still in there, just truly always delicious and price is unbeatable. Also love the cascahuin plata 48, in my top 3 possibly, always give me a very floral/piney aroma, with some allspice, agave, vegetal &amp; mineral tasting notes, very peppery but just delicious, great finish, price also unbeatable. Of course Fortaleza Still Strength could be my #1/2 on any given day, its just pure magic in a bottle, they could charge me double and Id happily pay (hope they dont read these!) Id also probably put Wild Common (cascahuin distilled) in my top 5 as it exhibits a lot of the cascahuin nuances of course, and the quality/nose/taste is top tier similar to all cascahuin stuff. My most recent purchase was the Tesoro XA &amp; I must say, supping it side by side with G4 XA, the El Tesoro is wayy better, of course in my opinion. I will say of all G4 products, I really only find i like the repo, thats a top tier sipper. The blanco/110 &amp; XA were just ok to me, not bad, not great. \n\nIm currently on the hunt for Ocho Plata Puntas (overproof) - saw some online but not ready to pull the trigger.

I thought this was gonna get like 10 upvotes but all the support is great. Also for anyone else wondering why I had a beaker with meth residue in it. A methhead found me phone this one night after I lost it after a night out. I asked him if I could do anything for him cause it would‚Äôve been 200$ to replace my phone. He said if I had any dope and I said I could get him some and I used the beaker to make sure I got a gram for him from my plug I used to use. Thanks again to everyone for all the support I‚Äôve slept now it was scary not knowing when I would be able to fall asleep after 48+ hours up but I feel alot better now and have ate\n\nThe reason I have a beaker with meth residue is a different story. But I drank the rest of a tequila bottle this morning. There was barely any left and I wanted to know how much there was so I poured in a small 100ml beaker. It was 60mls, which doesn‚Äôt matter, I was just curious so I drank it and finished getting ready. \n\nI had also stayed up all night which I didn‚Äôt plan to but I had to because of a family matter. Yes I know drinking alcohol to start the day, even when the new day bleeds into yesterday because of not sleeping isn‚Äôt healthy or smart but that‚Äôs not our topic today.\n\nWhen I was listening to music I was really feeling it. At first I thought I was just at the point where after your brain is awake for too long, you eventually switch to a hyper state suddenly and aren‚Äôt tired anymore. Kinda like you‚Äôre manic (that‚Äôs just how it feels to me when it happens) so I was thankful and feeling good. \n\nThen I started realizing I felt a little too good and I felt euphoric from the music a little too much. And I realized I wasn‚Äôt sure if I had washed out the beaker. I remember thinking to myself ‚Äúeven if there is it‚Äôs bit nearly enough to do anything‚Äù\n\nAnd as I‚Äôm listening to everlong acoustic version by foo fighters, this feeling is so great and it‚Äôs all coming back to me. I‚Äôm sure I have the strength to not willingly touch it ever again. But for now I just don‚Äôt want this feeling to end. It barely was any which is crazy. I can feel the clenched jaw and taste meth breath from the dryness. \n\nAnyways I don‚Äôt know where else to go with this I just feel like I just threw away almost 7 months because.

My sister is no contact with him, in part to how his wife (remarried) behaves and has caused some serious issues. \n\nI don\'t see my Dad that frequently anymore, a few times a year even though he only lives a few hours away. He\'s starting to slow down, and having health problems and I recognize time together is precious and really have made an effort to see him more, especially now that he is a grandfather as of 15 months ago.\n\n His wife is a really nasty woman. This is an understatement and I could write a novel about her antics, but she has apologized and started medication and made an effort to control herself better. \n\nI am big on second (and even third and forth chances) so I have been amicable with her mainly to maintain a relationship with my father. \n\nThey came into town for the night, mainly because his wife wanted to see her dentist that\'s 2 hours away, but a convenient opportunity for them to spend time. They were to stay at a hotel close by, we don\'t have a big house and extra space for them to be comfortable. \n\nThey got here, everything was "fine" and 30 minutes later, my wife sees her offering a glass of tequila on the rocks to my 15 month old son. My wife calls her out and says what the he\'ll are you doing?\n\nShe responds defensively, saying it\'s only a little and proceeds to pull a tequila soaked ice cube out her glass to offer it to him. At this point my wife starts yelling and all hell breaks loose. I calm and firmly explain to my Dad\'s wife that it\'s not OK, and I don\'t care if it\'s orange juice she needs to get permission to offer him anything whatsoever, especially alcohol. \n\nShe never had kids of her own for what its worth. She freaks out, offended by my wife and I giving her a hard time, and yells to my Dad to take her home. I explain that she can simply apologize for her mistake and respect our rules as parents but "her feeling" were hurt. \n\nThey leave and my dad calls me a few minutes later, he said she is taking his car back home with or without him and he wanted to know if I would drive him home (2 hours each way)  so he can stay and hang out. \n\nAt this point, I\'m angry and frustrated with the situation and said that maybe he should just come down another weekend without her. He apologized and that was that. \n\n30 minutes later, his wife shows up at my door. I\'m too pissed off at everything, and frustrated that she keeps getting in the way of an opportunity for me to spend quality time with my father and son to talk to her. My wife went to talk to her and she apologized and was upset and then she asked for the food they had brought (KFC) back (wtf). \n\nLater, I get a text from my Dad that he wants to have breakfast together in the morning and his wife knows she was wrong so we can smooth things over. I responded that I had already made plans because they told us they were going hone. \n\nI am sick of being jerked around. I don\'t have time to do anything for myself anymore and we had been planning this weekend for over a month. For them to pull the plug over something his stupid wife did that was fucked up really pissed me off. It\'s not fair to me or my wife, we work all week and as new parents and rarely have time to do anything fun or for ourselves. We carved this weekend out for them, and then they bail, only to ask to have plans the next day to smooth over there bullshit. \n\nI wanted to send the message that if they don\'t respect our time and rules as parents they loose that privilege and they don\'t get to just flip flop on when we see them.\n\nDid we have a right to be that pissed about her offering "a tiny bit of tequila"? \n\nDid I handle this the right way? \n\nWhy is something like spending quality time as a family so fucking difficult? \n\nI apologize for the rant, just a tired and frustrated Dad with a lack of fulfillment venting. \n\nHow was your day?', 't2_3cjfknr2', 'My dads wife gave my 15 month old Tequila', 't3_145onbb', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/comments/145onbb/my_dads_wife_gave_my_15_month_old_tequila/'), ('13wl4l4', Timestamp('2023-05-31 07:38:10-0500', tz='America/Chicago'), 'u_Sunny-DD', 't5_6rfg1o', '', 't2_qfrxp7lm', 'To celebrate getting in to the top 10% üéâ in my first month on OnlyFans, I‚Äôm giving you 50% off for the next week üçæ!

When I was drinking, I almost always felt guilty and ashamed, not just because of the drinking itself, but also because of the things I said and did or didn‚Äôt say or do while I was drinking and hungover. So, I was almost always trying to make up for what a terrible person I thought I was. I was trying to *earn* back some of the sense of respect and love and worthiness that my drinking took from me. I always had a running to-do list, and I was never sitting still. I partied hard and then worked hard to make up for it. It was exhausting.\r  \n\r  \nWhen I first quit drinking, I was too physically and mentally drained to do much besides stay sober. My to-do list shrunk down to one item: Do the next right thing. Ever so slowly, I put together a few days and then a few weeks of sobriety and I started to feel better. My lizard brain told me it was time to expand my to-do list again to make up for lost time.\r  \n\r  \nBut, my recovery brain said nope! I had come across this quote, ‚ÄúTake more time and cover less ground,‚Äù and it gave me a new perspective. I could take my time and enjoy what I was doing. I don‚Äôt have to *earn* anything because I‚Äôm already worthy. I can mindfully write out a reasonable to-do list and then try to stick to it, or show myself some grace if I don‚Äôt get everything done.\r  \n\r  \nAs we head into a new week, I hope we can show ourselves and each other some grace. I hope we can leave a few items off our to-do lists, or at least include a few activities that bring us joy. So, my question for you today is *What is something you can do this week that brings you joy?*\n\r  \nIWNDWYT!üíôüò∏", 't2_ecx8oll8', 'The Daily Check-In for Monday, June 26th: Just for today, I am NOT drinking!', 't3_14j6bza', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/14j6bza/the_daily_checkin_for_monday_june_26th_just_for/'), ('14k2o89', Timestamp('2023-06-26 22:55:40-0500', tz='America/Chicago'), 'stopdrinking', 't5_2s7yr', "We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common.

I want to talk about our sober toolboxes on this terrific Tuesday. There are all sorts of tools out there that we can use to help us stay sober. There are as many tools as there are sober cats. Some tools that serve us really well in the beginning wear out and lose their usefulness as we move along the sober path. Sometimes we‚Äôre scrolling through the DCI and someone mentions a tool that is the tool we didn‚Äôt even realize we were missing. Maybe we hear people talking about a tool that‚Äôs been a lifesaver for them but when we try it out, it‚Äôs awkward and unhelpful for us.\n\nWhether it‚Äôs day one or day 100 or day 1000, we can all benefit from taking an inventory of our toolboxes and making sure we‚Äôve got all the right tools for the job. Please take this opportunity to help your fellow sobernauts by sharing your experience and wisdom. And while you‚Äôre at it, take a quick moment to inventory your own toolbox and see if you might benefit from adding another tool. (I realize I‚Äôm using the word ‚Äòtool‚Äô a lot and at this point it‚Äôs sounding weird. Thank you for bearing with me.)\n\n*Which tool is most useful to you these days?* A book? A song? A podcast?

I want to share a struggle I\'ve been having lately. It has to do with my job. I work in health care, for a great big corporation. The work itself can be stressful, and the environment can be toxic. You know how SD is full of hope and encouragement and support and honest, respectful communication? My work environment can be the opposite of that.\n\nSo, I often have a awful time when I\'m at work. I could be happy and really enjoying my morning, and then I walk into work and I\'m stressed and angry within 30 minutes. And it was driving me crazy because I don\'t want to be miserable at work. But it seemed like I couldn\'t help but get sucked into the toxicity.\n\nThen one day I kind of stepped outside of myself and tried to observe what was going on. I realized that I was doing something I have been doing my whole life: being codependent. I was feeling like I had to get right in to the bullshit with my coworkers. If they\'re grumpy and stressed, I need to be a \'good\' coworker and join them.\n\nI grew up in a codependent and alcoholic home. If Mom or Dad was upset, I had to be upset too, and it was my job to make them feel better. Only if they were happy was it safe for me to be happy. I\'m really good at attaching myself to other people\'s emotions and let them call the shots.\n\nI wrote this on a little piece of paper and carry it with me into work every day: "I do not have to match the energy in the room." So far, it\'s helping me to remember that I don\'t have to feel responsible for how the people around me are feeling.\n\nIt occurred to me that of course I do this outside of work too. And this was a big motivation for my drinking! It\'s exhausting trying to take care of everyone around me, and drinking provided some relief. And, if the people around me were drinking I needed to join them in their drunken state. Now, I\'m practicing checking in with myself to see how I\'m feeling and thinking about what I can do to try to enjoy myself at work or wherever.\n\n*How are you feeling today, sober cats? What are you doing to take care of yourself today?*\n\nThank you for being here!

You\'ve been a great crowd to travel with this week. Anyone wanting to take the helm, tell u/SaintHomer. Believe me, you\'ll feel like a rock star. \nYou all are some of the kindest, most encouraging people. Just a reminder to be kind to yourselves, too. If you wouldn\'t say it to a friend, don\'t say it to yourself. Our words have power. Even little things like saying "I can\'t drink" vs. I choose not to drink, can impact our feelings about a situation. "I have to live with not drinking" vs "I get to live life unimpaired". The more we work on our thoughts and self talk, the more we can heal. Giving yourself a little mantra can be helpful. You can create your own that is meaningful to you. I have one from my third grade teacher, Mr. Ellingson. We all had to make little badges that said "I am loveable and capable, and so are you." I didn\'t really get it then and yet it stuck with me for approximately 46 years.

I wish I could comment to each of you personally.\nSo, one thing I love about SD is how positive it is. People may be struggling but there is lots of support and encouragement. And people are cheering on day counts whether someone is on day 1, 7, 30, or 500 or more. Just witnessing the camaraderie  lifts my spirits. Well, yesterday, I got my Reader\'s Digest Magazine(I might be an old lady, hee hee) And there is an article that explains this exact phenomenon. It\'s called freudenfreude and it "describes the bliss we feel when someone else succeeds, even if it doesn\'t directly involve us." It is the opposite of schadenfreude, or taking pleasure in someone\'s misfortune. Schadenfreude isn\'t all bad. It has it\'s purpose but too much of it can actually lower our self esteem according to the article. Whereas, Freudenfreude can enhance relationships and improve mood. The article ends with "celebrating our friends\' successes- big and small- helps us all triumph in the end." So, today, I will practice freudenfreude by saying how proud I am of each of you. You might be on day one for the millionth time or you might be cruising along at 5 years, but you are going against society\'s grain and making a tough choice. You are succeeding one day at a time and it\'s beautiful.

It‚Äôs me, Momma Cat, and I‚Äôm so happy I get to be the DCI host this week! SD and the DCI and all of you are super important tools in my sober toolbox, so I feel especially grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this community.\r  \n\r  \nI‚Äôm hosting in June in honor of my sweet Mom, who died from complications of alcoholism 4.5 years ago. She taught me that every single one of us is worthy of love, especially those of us that struggle with addiction, and that we have to start with learning how to love ourselves. Learning to love myself is definitely a work in progress. Hopefully hosting will help me (and all of us) in this endeavor.\r  \n\r  \nAs part of my recovery, I go to 12 step meetings. A couple of months ago someone at a meeting said that she often asks herself, ‚ÄòHow easily am I willing to surrender my serenity?‚Äô and this question has stuck with me since then. I picture my serenity as this little ball of light that I hold in my hand. If I‚Äôm not paying attention, I‚Äôll surrender my serenity (hand over my little ball of light) to the driver in front of me going 5 miles under the speed limit, to my annoying coworker that won‚Äôt stop complaining, to my own lizard brain that‚Äôs reminding me of that one dumb thing I did during a night of drinking, to my teenage daughter who leaves her shoes laying all over the house. This question helps me to remember that I am the one letting other people or circumstances or memories take away my serenity.

I hope everyone is ready to face Wednesday. It\'s officially the first day of summer here! Where is the time going?!?!\nHere\'s my thoughts for today: One reason I drank was social anxiety, just to feel more at ease. Getting sober can also feel scary. We don\'t want to stand out from the crowd. We don\'t want to explain to people. We don\'t know how else to cope with stress or other emotions. I saw this quote on Facebook the other day and found it kind of uplifting. \n"When you\'re nervous about stepping outside of your comfort zone, remind yourself:\n"It feels scary because it\'s unfamiliar, not because I\'m incapable." Michell C.Clark\n\nWe are all capable of NOT drinking. It may be scary because we are now facing things unimpaired. We are feeling all the feelings, both good and bad. Doing this without the crutch of alcohol is unfamiliar. BUT we are CAPABLE. And we don\'t have to do it alone. We have each other. Keep your heads in the game!

Happy Wednesday! I thought we could talk about our 'whys' today. There are the big and more obvious reasons to quit drinking: no more hangovers or black-outs, saved money, better sleep, better relationships. (I'm still waiting for the sleep improvement, darn it.)\n  \n\n  \nAnd there are the smaller benefits that sneak up on us. Here's one that I've noticed recently: being able to enjoy things just for the heck of it. Like, watching the birds play in the fountain on my front porch, or listening to my husband tell Dad jokes, or reading random books that catch my eye at the library.\n  \n\n  \nIt's weird that alcohol has a reputation for making things fun. It wasn't doing that for me by the end, and hadn't been for a long time. I wasn't enjoying my life when I was drinking. But now I catch myself enjoying random moments. I'm redefining what fun looks like for me. Now if someone asks me why I quit drinking, one of my 'whys' would be that I want to enjoy my life!\n  \n\n  \n*What are a couple of your reasons for getting sober?

I hope everyone is feeling strong and remembering all their tools for sobriety. I thought maybe my story would encourage people who have started over numerous times. I've been working on getting sober for 8 to 10 years, after about 30 years of drinking. I came here about 4 years ago after a fight with my husband about my drinking. I had a pretty good streak, then it was hit or miss. I think I only reset my badge once, but that was because I just couldn't face resetting it every time I actually drank. I joined a couple of internet groups from which I also gained good info. However, my mind/heart wasn't really in it, although I knew I needed to quit. I kind of gave up on quitting for another couple years. Then 455 days ago, I came back. I also went to an intensive outpatient program, which was mostly online. I finally was able to stop questioning the decision to stop. I stopped entertaining the idea that somehow I could drink. I still can have cravings at certain times but through skills I've learned, especially playing the tape forward, I no longer look at alcohol as a solution. Alcohol and I have broken up and we are never, ever getting back together again. So, the point of this is to say, quitting may not be linear. It may not be accomplished the  first time. It may not be easy. I had to keep trying new things, humbling myself to accept help. I had to do it one day at a time. I believe anyone can do it.

This week is going so fast. It is a great joy to host for a week. I wanted to give back to the place that is my biggest support in my sober journey.

Trust me, if I can do it, anybody can! \nSo I didn\'t have a lot of mental space to think today, so I am getting in my helpful quote file. I like keeping quotes that seem powerful to me, so that I can re-read them on occasion.  Today\'s words of wisdom are from the rock legend Tina Turner.\n"We all have it within our power to make decisions and take actions that elevate us. Every day, we express who we are, and who we wish to become, through our thoughts, words and deeds. Choose the positive path in everything you do. Spread positivity and kindness. That\'s the way. My legacy is that I stayed on course, from beginning to the end..because I believed in something inside of me."\n\nChoosing sobriety and taking the actions to maintain it is the greatest decision I have made. It allows me to spread positivity and kindness and I do believe in myself now. My wish is that each of you see your value and treat yourselves with kindness today, no matter where you are on this path.

So, celebrating Father's Day with my dad, made me think about how each of us can be creating a legacy for our families. Our choice to stop drinking doesn't just impact us, but our families and friends and really, the world around us. My dad came from a family of problematic drinkers. Part of them quit drinking early in life. My dad quit when I was about 3. I have no childhood memories of him drinking. He quit because my mom took me and left. He never had another drink while I was growing up. One of my closest uncles also quit due to a scary incident. My cousins and I used to talk about how good it was that they had just quit. We didn't understand addiction at that age, but we still knew it was unusual to just quit. So I appreciate growing up with that example and also the fact that because my dad quit, I had a stable childhood. While many of my cousins and of course, myself, still had problems with alcohol, we also had that knowledge that quitting was possible. I don't have kids to set an example for but I am a better family member and a better friend. I just want to encourage all of you that you are doing a worthwhile thing in fighting for sobriety. We still do it for ourselves but it helps everyone. Sober power to you all this Monday.

I had an interesting encounter the other night that I want to share with you. My sobriety was questioned by someone and I was caught off guard. I didn't drink but it reminded me that I need to be ready with a short and firm answer.\n\nMy husband and I met with our financial advisor for an annual update at a restaurant. This is a person that I had partied with when I was still drinking and I know that he still parties. But I hadn't seen him in a year. I didn't think anything of it, which was an oversight on my part.\n\nWe ate dinner and talked money, and then the financial advisor wanted to wrap things up with a shot. I said 'no thanks, I don't drink anymore' and he was surprised. He asked why and said one shot wouldn't hurt. I said I was done with hangovers and black-outs, so nope. He asked a few more times and I said no thanks a few more times. Thankfully after that he gave up.\n\nIf this had happened earlier in my sobriety or at a weaker moment, I might have caved. But here are a couple of things that helped: I've talked with my husband a lot about my sobriety, so he had my back. And, I knew that it didn't matter what my financial advisor thinks of me and my drinking. I didn't need to drink for his sake.\n\nHere's my question for today: *Do you have an answer prepared if someone asks you to drink with them? If so, what is it?* I know there are so many different scenarios, and that often the easiest way to handle this is to avoid it all together. But sometimes we're caught off guard. Let's help each other strengthen our sober muscles and be ready! Thank you for being here!

If you know who I am, please respect my privacy. I just want to post and share my story with like minded people. \n\nI took a trip with my family to Utah and went to the church administration building for a meeting the a Q15 member to set apart my father as a Mission President and my mom as a missionary. We met in his office along with other members of my family. \n\nMy father asked me before hand that, if this apostle invites family to join the circle for the setting apart, he would like me to join, as long as I‚Äôm okay with that. I said, ‚Äúthis is your thing, not mine, if that is what you would like then that is what I‚Äôll do.‚Äù\n\nSo as we were in this apostle‚Äôs, extremely nice, office. He invited the men in the room to join him in the circle to set apart my parents. \n\nSo there I was, a true blue exmormon, who just had a coffee 30 minutes prior, stood next to one of the apostles and set apart my father as a mission president. \n\nSome of my family members showed little nuance and fragile belief by expressing sentiments afterwards like ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe we just met with someone who has seen Jesus‚Äù. \n\nTo me, meeting with this apostle just felt like meeting another old man. I actually felt somewhat sorry for these 15 men. When normally they would be retired and spending time with family and traveling, they still come into a downtown office building and work 9 hours a day putting on face. \n\nWe also ran into good ole J. Roy Holland on our way out. We just turned a corner and he was right there. He was hunched over, using a cane and being escorted/assisted by a large bodyguard of sorts that was helping him walk. He looked fragile and old but when he noticed us, he stood up straight and put on face and exchanged superficial pleasantries. I wish they would just let these old men retire from the Q15 and just go home and live their last years in peace. \n\nSome people may criticize me for participating in an event that I know is all make believe. Well that‚Äôs part of the reason why I deceived to join, it‚Äôs all make believe. And I wasn‚Äôt going to stand out and make a scene during an important event for my family/parents just to prove a point. Part of me did want to stand out and show this apostle that even people in mission presidents family‚Äôs are leaving the church but I knew this meeting was very important to them and just played Mormon for a moment for the sake of my relationship with my parents because I won‚Äôt be around them for 3 years and want them to leave with us on the right terms. \n\nTLDR; I, a full blown exmormon, joined the setting apart circle with an apostle to set my father apart as a mission president. \n\nWhy? Because it‚Äôs a special moment for my dad and didn‚Äôt want to spoil it for him and spoil my shaky relationship with him just to prove a point.

I don't even think that half of the alcohol consumed socially here is actually consumed with enthusiasm, it's just a quick race to inebriation so that you can let go of social anxiety and be accepted by the group.\n\nThe problem is this is not just the odd wild night out, it's every fucking social situation. BBQ? Get hammered. Public holiday? Get hammered. Any kind of work do or family reunion or meeting up with old friends? Get hammered.\n\nThe integration of drinking culture with work is particularly strange to me. In most countries it's definitely not normal to be lying on the pavement at 3am with your boss, puking or pissing yourself, but here in many work places if you don't partake in that, you're basically losing social points at that job. Mid week drinks in the other countries I've lived in would be 1-2 beers or a glass of wine, a chat and maybe some food, possibly a pub quiz then home after 2-3 hours. Here? Up until 2am on a Wednesday getting paraplegic.\n\nSorry for the rant, I obviously love living here for many other reasons but I'm starting to be conscious of the fact that my entire friendship group is non-Australian because I'm just getting really tired of having to keep up with the mandatory drinking that seems to come with being friends with most Aussies.\n\nObviously binge drinking is a big deal elsewhere but it does tend to be 1) looked down on and 2) grown out of by most people in their 30s.

Long time reader first time hoster here.  Happy Sunday funday!  I recently hit two months of no booze.  For me the further I get from day 1 the more I worry about slipping up (I hate the word relapse), because of how shitty of a spot I was in and how shitty I felt isn‚Äôt as fresh in my mind.  So I am trying to keep sobriety a top priority in my life and never say the dreaded words ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got this,‚Äù like I‚Äôve screwed myself by saying (in my head) in the past.    \nSomeone posted this quote in a chat I was in recently and it really hit home and was something I needed to hear.  ‚ÄúSobriety is never owned, it‚Äôs rented, and rent is due everyday.‚Äù  So I‚Äôve been trying to do something for my sobriety every day, and to remember that whether I‚Äôm on day 1 or 10000, I‚Äôm only an arm's length from grabbing booze and being back on that horrendous path.    \nSo what are you doing today for your sobriety or mental health in general?  Could be as simple as a phone call to someone who supports you, to reading this post, to going to a meeting, to going for a walk in nature, to petting your dog.  I‚Äôm going to work then doing a zoom chat later, plus trying to read most of the comments on this post.

For me it was that all my enjoyment was reduced to one thing. Its not even that it was that great. Its just by that point, everything else didn‚Äôt mean much.\n\nSo to those who struggle with the weekend I feel ya. I found ways to fill the time. Honestly, it was sleeping and moping around mostly at first. Then some walking eventually.

While I may not be able to read all, I try to catch up with as many as possible. Some of you are thriving and that truly warms my heart! For those who are struggling, know that I feel your pain. I\'ve been there too. Among these, a few comments stood out to me, filled with despair and questioning: When? When will I be happy? When does it get easier?\n\nFrom my personal experience, I can say it often takes longer than you\'d want, but also, relief comes before you know it. Initially, every successful sober day felt like a hard-won battle. Then it was a string of "blah" days. And one regular day, without any fanfare, I realized I felt alive again. The significance of this transformation only became apparent in hindsight.\n\nThat was my journey, but let\'s get into some science for a more generalized view. According to a study published in the European Journal of Social Psychology, the process of habit formation can range from as short as 18 days to as long as 254 days, with an average of 66 days.\n\nSo, what does this mean? It means your journey is unique. You might find it gets easier sooner, or it might take a while. The crucial thing to remember is that every sober day brings you one step closer to your goal.\n\nRemember, choosing to not drink is hard, but it gets easier.\n\nBonus info: In the study, a habit was defined as a behavior that has become automatic due to its frequent repetition. Which is way more than I could have hoped for in the beginning.', 't2_5djn38xn', 'The Daily Check-In for Tuesday, June 6th: Just for today, I am NOT drinking!', 't3_1422wy8', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1422wy8/the_daily_checkin_for_tuesday_june_6th_just_for/'), ('143yok3', Timestamp('2023-06-07 23:02:27-0500', tz='America/Chicago'), 'stopdrinking', 't5_2s7yr', "*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common.

I had just gotten out of the hospital, felt weak and sick, and just‚Ä¶\n\nalone\n\nNobody to talk to that would get it. It felt like the people that knew I was in the hospital treated me differently. I got home and sat on my couch and cried‚Ä¶\n\nalone\n\nI had a week before I went back to work. A week\n\nalone\n\nBut here's what I discovered - I wasn't actually alone. I am part of this amazing, supportive community here at SD. We‚Äôre all sailing this sea. Each of us guiding our own ship, but never alone in the waters.\n\nEvery story shared, every struggle voiced, every victory celebrated, and even every setback discussed here isn't just a personal act. We're reminding each other and ourselves that we're part of something bigger. We are lighting a beacon of hope for someone else with each post and each comment. \n\nPersonally, hosting the DCI has enhanced my sense of connection to this community. It's been a way to give back, to offer support, and to strengthen my commitment. If this sounds like an experience you'd be interested in, and you've maintained your sobriety for at least 30 days, I'd recommend reaching out to /u/SaintHomer. He'll guide you on how to host the DCI!\n\nRemember, choosing not to drink is hard, but it does get easier - especially when you have a community behind you.

While it's not possible for me to get to each one, I'm taking the time to soak in as much as I can. One theme I've noticed, which resonates with my own journey, is that sobriety doesn't necessarily bring constant happiness or excitement. There's no nirvana moment where everything becomes perfect.\n\nSobriety can, in fact, feel surreal. It introduces us to a new normal, where we face life's ups and downs, mundane moments, and occasional horrors, all without the veil of alcohol. But guess what? That's the beauty of it. We get to genuinely experience life, not an alcohol-fueled distortion of it. And there's something incredibly liberating about that.\n\nThe journey of recovery may seem repetitive, like chopping wood and carrying water. And it's true, it often involves doing the next right thing, keeping our heads where our feet are, and maintaining a steely resolve. But the payoff? Priceless freedom and an authenticity of existence that drinking never allows.\n\nLife sober consists of good days, bleh days, and flat days. It's not always glamorous, but we get to be present for all of it. We get to listen to the universe when it whispers, find gratitude in ordinary days, and grow through every experience.\n\nIn essence, choosing to not drink can be hard, but it gets easier. And more than that, it gets real. Real in a way that lets us truly live, not just exist.\n\nIWNDWYT, SD!", 't2_5djn38xn', 'The Daily Check-In for Wednesday, June 7th: Just for today, I am NOT drinking!', 't3_1432r2e', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1432r2e/the_daily_checkin_for_wednesday_june_7th_just_for/'), ('148kv4p', Timestamp('2023-06-13 12:33:24-0500', tz='America/Chicago'), 'OneOrangeBraincell', 't5_5vej89', '', 't2_2wclokxn', 'My cat drinking rain water on top of his clean water bottle ...', 't3_148kv4p', 'https://v.redd.it/xgnd6b1fmt5b1'), ('14buqou', Timestamp('2023-06-17 11:04:49-0500', tz='America/Chicago'), 'Whatcouldgowrong', 't5_2x2oy', '', 't2_fwekfr9p', 'WCGW Drinking while driving', 't3_14buqou', 'https://v.redd.it/321lahe8ql6b1'), ('1411jbk', Timestamp('2023-06-04 23:03:41-0500', tz='America/Chicago'), 'stopdrinking', 't5_2s7yr', "\\*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common.

A strategy that really helped me make my commitment stick was a simple pact I made with myself: before taking any drinks, I would post here and share my thoughts. The support I received in response was immense and helped me feel less isolated.\r  \n\r  \nI remember moments when I was shattered, crying over a breakup, consumed by how much I missed her, and feeling utterly lost. I wasn't making much sense. It was a raw dump of thoughts and feelings, and honestly, it felt a bit cringey looking back. But someone from this community always commented, always reached out and provided me with a sense of comfort.\r  \n\r  \nSo, for those who are new to the journey, or those finding it difficult, I encourage you to share your thoughts here before you make a decision you might regret. It's okay if your post feels a little cringey, a little raw. It just might be the thing that stops you in time.\r  \n\r  \nFor those who've been in the same situation, don't hesitate to share some of your own cringey posts to demonstrate that we've all been there.

Happy Saturday.\n\nThis is my last post this week and I've been thinking about the future a lot. Every day we choose not to drink, we're shaping a better tomorrow. Quitting alcohol isn't just about stopping a habit, it's about redefining ourselves and deciding who we want to be.\n\nSure, there are tough days. There are times we mess up, get knocked down, and feel the raw pain of trying to change. That's okay. It's part of this journey. We acknowledge the struggle, get back up, learn from it, and keep going.\n\nOne of the greatest things about this path we're on is the chance to start fresh each day. Every morning offers a new opportunity to make progress, to heal, to grow. And yes, like I've said all week, it's hard. It can be really hard. But every day, it gets a little bit easier.\n\nA powerful reminder that we're not alone in this journey is the activity on our subreddit. Since my last check-in, there have been 185 individual posts (as of the time of writing), with a staggering 6475 combined upvotes and comments. That's a lot of support, a lot of shared experiences, a lot of solidarity. \n\nYour posts matter. \n\nYour support matters. \n\nYou matter.  \n\nKeep going, keep trying, keep healing. Remember, it's hard, but it gets easier. It really does.\n\nAnd as a reminder, if you have 30+ days sober and you'd like to host the DCI, reach out to /u/SaintHomer and he‚Äôll get you set up!\n\nIWNDWYT", 't2_5djn38xn', 'The Daily Check-In for Saturday, June 10th: Just for today, I am NOT drinking!', 't3_145pxld', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/145pxld/the_daily_checkin_for_saturday_june_10th_just_for/'), ('13k7yci', Timestamp('2023-05-17 12:14:51-0500', tz='America/Chicago'), 'UkraineWarVideoReport', 't5_5wjmo8', '', 't2_dk0s0lar', 'Typical Russian day on the frontlines.

Because it is hard but, it got a little easier.\r  \n\r  \nIn my darker times, I suffered many losses due to my drinking - jobs, a wonderful girlfriend, and a significant amount of my health. These losses ironically made it even more difficult to commit to sobriety. The mindset of, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve already lost so much. I‚Äôm a loser. What‚Äôs a little more to lose?‚Äù was all too easy to fall into. I felt unwell daily and even spent a month stuck in a hospital bed, unable to climb stairs without exhaustion or even finish a sentence without getting winded. Starting over is hard, but it got easier.\r  \n\r  \nFast forward to today, my life is unrecognizably better. I have a lovely puppy, a job I enjoy that is supported by an accommodating team, and my health has improved vastly. I rise early, enjoy jogging or biking, and barely notice conquering flights of stairs effortlessly. My diet has never been healthier, I'm cooking more and enjoying takeout less, and I'm consistently gaining strength and endurance. Work has become a place of learning and achievement. Above all, I'm able to spend endless amounts of time with my dog, who I absolutely adore. I can't even remember the last time I craved a drink. It was hard, but it got easier.\r  \n\r  \nHere, in this community, we choose to tackle the hard part. To commit to sobriety today. To make it easier for tomorrow.\r  \n\r  \nSending you all strength and good vibes. This community is truly remarkable. Here's to making each day a little easier, together. \r  \nIWNDWYT", 't2_5djn38xn', 'The Daily Check-In for Sunday, June 4th: Just for today, I am NOT drinking!', 't3_1400sfy', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1400sfy/the_daily_checkin_for_sunday_june_4th_just_for/'), ('14ddle2', Timestamp('2023-06-19 07:41:15-0500', tz='America/Chicago'), 'Teachers', 't5_2qqcs', "Yes, you heard that right.

Now, about a year later, I've tried to branch out and find other drinks that aren't just plain ol' water yet aren't chock full of sugar or some problematic sweetener. I'm back to having a specialty soda or a ginger ale very occasionally; not even because I miss soda, but because I just want something different.\n\nLooking into this kind question already, tons of answers end up suggesting sparkling waters, seltzers, and infused waters. Now normally I'm not a picky eater, but having tried all of these on several occasions, I just don't like them for different reasons. I've also tried kombucha but it sorta turned my stomach, which was a bummer, and I don't know whether or not one should be drinking that constantly due to the bacteria anyway (correct me if I'm wrong, I just don't know). I also tried coconut water a long time ago, and while I didn't like it at the time, I think I'll give it another shot now that I think about it. I've always enjoyed some cold teas or juices, but finding things that I can drink frequently throughout the day without overloading on sugar has been the main challenge.\n\nTL;DR - Aside from water and its spinoffs, what things do you guys like to drink on the regular? Is anyone else picky with sparking/seltz/infused waters but found a kind that you like? Are there any teas or juices you might recommend that don't have a lot of added sugar and such?\n\nBonus question: Are there any sweeteners you're okay with, or any you'd recommend against having?\n\nEDIT: Thank you everyone for all of your responses!

You see, I never found the inclination to try non-alcoholic beers. Too close to what kills me and I liken it to playing with fire. But mocktails... you see where this is going?\n\nI find myself sitting across from my wife of 10 years on an anniversary dinner in, of all places, Lexington VA. The young man (maybe 20 years old) serving us looked excited when I responded to his order for drinks with "lets try a mocktail! Would you please substitute the tequila in your spicy maragarita to seltzer water or ginger ale?"\n\nHe politely obliged and minutes later, I received my drink and took a sip.\n\nI knew something was wrong immediately. The taste was putrid and I had flashes of memories long put away. I asked the waiter "are you sure there\'s no alcohol in this mocktail?"\n\nHe assured me there was not, so I took another sip. Still, something was wrong and I knew it in my gut.\n\nI stopped drinking it, and a few minutes later the waiter ran back to my table (finally understanding the gravity of the situation), and grabs the drinks with near tears in his eyes.\n\n"I am SO SORRY, sir, the bartender misunderstood... there is alcohol in this!"\n\nAs I figured this was the case, I calmly responded, "thats ok, please take it."\n\nThe waiter came back twice to apologize. The bartender tried making me a real mocktail which I politely declined. The owner finally came over and put the dessert on the house.\n\nThe kid waiting on us still looked like he was on the verge of tears.\n\nI shook his hand and said, "thank you for letting me know, its OK, nothing is wrong here."\n\nMy wife was near tears as well for me, not knowing that I was perfectly OK with the accident. Long ago, I told myself this was an inevitability and that how I REACT is the only thing that matters. We cant expect to never encounter booze as we proceed with our sober lives. Its everywhere, and after 5 years of drop-less sobriety from alcohol, I mistakenly took two sips.\n\nDid I fall into a shame spiral and use it as an excuse to go wild? No.\n\nDid I panic and throw a temper tantrum because the world didn\'t exclusively cater to my sobriety? No.\n\nDo I count this as a reset to my 5 years of unblemished sobriety from alcohol? Hell No, not in the least. That would only occur when I have made the CHOICE to drink, not a mistake that can happen to anyone. \n\nDid I let it ruin our evening? Not for a moment.

Next year will be different, and I\'ll redirect that money elsewhere, but this year I thought I deserved treats for milestones, some small, some not so small.\n\nOne of my favourite things is a silver bracelet that spells out *IWNDWYT* in Morse Code, that I bought myself for two weeks sober, shortly after I joined this sub.\n\nTo mark my year, mum and I are going to a sewing show next month so I can try out sewing machines and buy a new one.\n\nI also have a sober treats category, for those days when I need chocolate or ice cream or something small because it\'s Thursday and I never could get the hang of Thursdays.\n\nI drink my AF drinks in the fancy glasses, because I can.\n\nHow are you rewarding yourself for a hard job done well?', 't2_saiqlk8', 'The Daily Check-In for Tuesday, May 23rd: Just for today, I am NOT drinking!', 't3_13pftyq', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/13pftyq/the_daily_checkin_for_tuesday_may_23rd_just_for/'), ('14ijzey', Timestamp('2023-06-25 06:30:04-0500', tz='America/Chicago'), 'Bunnies', 't5_2qojq', '', 't2_khaoiiqz', 'Little Phoenix drinking herbal tea', 't3_14ijzey', 'https://v.redd.it/qknztd4lg58b1'), ('13fns2r', Timestamp('2023-05-12 10:08:42-0500', tz='America/Chicago'), 'NatureIsFuckingLit', 't5_3gdh7', '', 't2_qjgqhn59', 'üî•Butterflies in Amazon drinking tears from the eyes of the turtle..', 't3_13fns2r', 'https://v.redd.it/uitm2m8x1fza1'), ('14d4nhf', Timestamp('2023-06-18 23:41:53-0500', tz='America/Chicago'), 'WeDoALittlePosting', 't5_4q1a3u', '', 't2_bdl1cwaap', 'I was drinking earlier now I‚Äôm driving ', 't3_14d4nhf', 'https://v.redd.it/8p5w2re8mw6b1'), ('13uak8i', Timestamp('2023-05-28 15:40:30-0500', tz='America/Chicago'), 'tifu', 't5_2to41', 'So I have a cat who escaped the house and came back the next day covered with fleas.

Now I was out in a bar privately and I saw the top managers (it's a flat hierarchy and it's not strange for even entry-level employees to be friends with the top execs) at the same place. They invited me and my friend to join them and then we went in a club and stayed out until the morning. We were all pretty drunk and had a good time. Now I'm being paranoid that it's really not a good look and that they will have a bad opinion about me, that I am not serious and professional. \n\nJust wondering what are people's thoughts on this? I guess since everyone else is drinking it's fine? After the first time I promised myself that I would never drink with coworkers again (because it's never just one drink with me). But the second time I didn't know I would see them at all and I was already drunk by the time we got together.\n\nDo you think this will affect people's perception of me? \n\nSide note, as I said I just started and I'm doing pretty good so far, I'm doing my best at least and working very hard.\n\nEdit: most people in the comments think I'm a man. I am a woman, single and (I'd like to think) attractive. I wonder if you think that makes things even worse for me. Someone pointed out that I should watch out for sexual harassment.

I also have a sunrise/sunset alarm that plays birdsong to wake me up, and a weighted blanket as part of my bedlinen.\n\n* half an hour before bedtime, I start my nighttime routine. I either switch off or switch to nighttime mode my electronics. I switch the electronic diffuser on and make sure the curtains (blackout lined) are closed.\n* I clean my teeth, do my nighttime skin routine, hop into bed.\n* I put my alarm clock into sunset mode, which gradually dims the light over half an hour or so\n* I start playing a sleep meditation on my phone, then put my phone to one side so it\'s out of the way\n* I don\'t think I\'ve ever made it to the end of the sleep meditation, because I\'m usually out cold within fifteen minutes of getting into bed üòÅ\n\nI use Insight Timer as my meditation app, and don\'t be afraid to flip from one meditation to another, there\'s nothing more annoying than lying there, rigid with irritation, trying to drift off, when all you can think is "this person has the most annoying voice in the history of the world." If meditation\'s not your thing, they do bedtime stories as well, but again, if the reader\'s voice is annoying, swap to a different recording.\n\nSleep is one of my weapons against cravings, because there\'s nothing like being under the duvet in your pyjamas with your teeth cleaned to stop a booze run.

"Oh, just water for me thanks, I have to cycle home."\n\n* For that first drink "oh, I\'m really thirsty, could I just get a water for now, please?"\n\n* once you have a glass in your hand, most people don\'t care what\'s in it.\n\n* I offer to bring some NA beer, or kombucha, or something else so I know there\'s something I like in the fridge.\n\n* I set myself a curfew - stay until after I\'ve eaten, stay until I\'ve spoken to x. I can stay later if I\'m enjoying myself but if everyone\'s spangled and a bit annoying, I know I have a time where I can slip away, like a little ghost.\n\nI\'ve only once had to deal with someone who was adamant I should have a glass of wine, and I finally glared at him and said "why are you dead set on getting me to do something I don\'t want to do?" and he looked slightly horrified and avoided me for the rest of the afternoon.\n\nSo what are your tips for sober socialising, especially where other people are drinking?

Put twice as much herbal tea in a jug as is recommended for the quantity of water you're using, so it's twice as strong. leave it to brew in the fridge overnight.

IWNDWYT.\r\n\nA wonderful thing about SD is the sheer diversity of people here. Ages, locations, situations across the spectrum. I‚Äôve been talking about SD as a whole for a couple days now.\r Today, however, I want to address a very special group of people.\r\n\nYou lurkers. You folks, quietly reading this sub without posting. Yes, you guys. I wanna talk to you directly for a moment because you are where I started. I can‚Äôt even count how many days I read SD with a glass in my hand, wanting to stop, wondering how the hell I was supposed to *start* stopping. But I kept at it, because while not all the posts applied to my situation, enough of them did for me to at least try sobriety for myself. Day ones happened. I kept reading. Day one fails happened. I kept reading. Eventually, I collected an arsenal of tools I could reach for when cravings got bad. Podcasts, Quit Lit, sobriety apps, and terms like ‚Äúplaying the tape forward‚Äù were all things I found here. I really appreciated finding info on non-AA groups. (I am one of those folks who isn‚Äôt quite down with 12 Step culture.) When reading SD now, if I see ‚ÄúLong time lurker, first time poster‚Äù threads, I tend to read them right away.\r\n\nI‚Äôd like to share a quote from the actress, Jane Elliot: \n\n‚ÄúWe don't need a melting pot, folks. We need a salad bowl. In a salad bowl, you put in the different things. You want the vegetables - the lettuce, the cucumbers, the onions, the green peppers - to maintain their identity. You appreciate differences.‚Äù\n\nSo if you‚Äôre lurking today, I want to reassure you that‚Äôs fine. No need to out yourself all of a sudden on this sub, or do anything dramatic to fit in. But give yourself and this sub a chance, because things do get better.\r\n\nMy experience was to wonder *when* things would get better, when I abruptly realized things had been getting better for some time, without me noticing. Mornings were different. Drunk Me would just get up in the morning, look around at the dirty laundry and the dirty house and all the dishes in the sink, and feel too overwhelmed to deal with any of it.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*\n\n**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**\n\nI'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.\n\nMaybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.\n\nIt doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!\n\n---\n\n**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!\n\nWhat happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.\n\n**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.\n\n**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.\n\n---\n\nThis post goes up at:\n\n- US - Night/Early Morning\n- Europe - Morning\n- Asia and Australia - Evening/Night\n\nA link to the current Daily Check-In post  can always be found near the top of the sidebar.\n\n---\n\nHere we are at day 7! So today I‚Äôm going to discuss the importance of certain numbers. Here‚Äôs today‚Äôs quote for consideration: \n\n‚ÄúWhen you have mastered numbers, you will in fact no longer be reading numbers, any more than you read words when reading books. You will be reading meanings.‚Äù\n--W. E. B. Du Bois\n\nLike many of you, I use a sobriety tracker app. It not only displays the number of sober days but also the savings on other things like money, time, and calories. Just so you all can follow along, here are my numbers:\n\n* 237 days sober\n* $1697.20 saved\n* 1188 hours saved\n* 220,941 calories saved\n\nThe thing is, these numbers aren‚Äôt important in and of themselves. As the saying goes, my numbers don‚Äôt tell the entire story. There is no final, perfect number of days for me to be sober. That number is just how far I‚Äôve gotten on telling myself IWNDWYT, up to **today**. It can‚Äôt tell me anything about what might happen tomorrow.\n\nThere is no ideal amount of money to ‚Äúearn back‚Äù in sobriety, that will mean I‚Äôve succeeded at staying sober. All that dollar amount means is that I can finally afford certain things that alcohol ‚Äútold‚Äù me were too expensive. However, it can‚Äôt make any suggestions on what I should buy **today** with that money.\n\nEveryone has some amount of time they no longer waste drinking. My number of hours may tell me how much time I have gotten back, but offers no clue on how to use the 24 hours I have available **today**.\n\nEven the calories statistic, while mind-boggling, doesn‚Äôt really help me much by itself. Sure, it explains why many people who go sober lose weight after a while. But no, it won‚Äôt give me any guidance on healthy choices for what I might eat **today**.\n\nThat said, why bother with tracking these numbers at all? Well, I do it for the same reason I find it fun to track my airplane flight from the passenger‚Äôs seat during the trip. It‚Äôs thrilling to look back and see how far I‚Äôve come. It‚Äôs interesting to check out the landmarks I‚Äôve just passed. I can look ahead, and see that I am indeed headed towards the destination I planned for. Once I‚Äôve done all that, I can look around the plane and see‚Ä¶\nThat I‚Äôm not alone, and that many other folks are on the same journey I am.\n\nIt‚Äôs been an amazing week. Thanks to one and all for putting up with my shenanigans. Some of you have shared things that have really touched me, or given me food for thought. Just a reminder: if you have 30 days or more of sobriety, you too can have an amazing week hosting! Just give u/SaintHomer a holler to get started.\n\nIWNDWYT.", 't2_pc9xau24', 'The Daily Check-In for Saturday, May 20th: Just for today, I am NOT drinking!', 't3_13missl', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/13missl/the_daily_checkin_for_saturday_may_20th_just_for/'), ('149n3ko', Timestamp('2023-06-14 18:53:26-0500', tz='America/Chicago'), 'progresspics', 't5_2sl0y', '', 't2_g7c5jt14', 'M/28/6‚Äô2‚Äù340&gt;260=80lbs finally quit smoking drinking and started into the health and fitness world', 't3_149n3ko', 'https://i.redd.it/dkjjvgv6n26b1.jpg'), ('14la0w1', Timestamp('2023-06-28 08:48:37-0500', tz='America/Chicago'), 'BlueArchive', 't5_2vhvtt', '', 't2_oy9su', "Another manga about Sensei drinking Saya's potion (by AYA-cis @GinMei182_e) Nonomi", 't3_14la0w1', 'https://i.redd.it/88dibotvjr8b1.png'), ('13kdedj', Timestamp('2023-05-17 15:39:38-0500', tz='America/Chicago'), 'nottheonion', 't5_2qnts', '', 't2_hbtix', "Lauren Boebert Defends Husband, Says He Doesn't 'Drink Bud Light'", 't3_13kdedj', 'https://www.newsweek.com/lauren-boebert-defends-husband-divorce-bud-light-1801005'), ('14fhijm', Timestamp('2023-06-21 14:52:53-0500', tz='America/Chicago'), 'oregon', 't5_2qhjg', '', 't2_884o7', 'Portland mayor compares new open-use drug ban to prohibiting drinking in public', 't3_14fhijm', 'https://katu.com/news/local/portland-mayor-compares-new-open-use-drug-ban-to-prohibiting-drinking-in-public-fentanyl-crisis-drug-measure-110-time-place-manner')
