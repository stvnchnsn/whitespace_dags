I understand that most things, when properly moderated, can be consumed without much issue but alcohol just seems to be a toxic relationship that always ends up creating problems for everyone. Whether it be drunk texts to your exes, DUI’s, or just general asshole-ery, people always run back to it. \\nI’ve heard stories of people being hesitant to attend weddings because of the dry factor. I’ve even heard about people taking shots or relying on alcohol to deal with social situations. Again I see the appeal with the (forgive me if I’m wrong) whole loosening effect, but it just seems to be a gateway to something more…. sinister? \\n\\nTo clear up why I’m curious, my mom was an alcoholic about 10-12 years ago. I never saw her drink, none of me or my sister have fetal alcohol syndrome, and I never had any inclination that she even tried alcohol before she told me about it about a year back. I hate to have heard about how alcohol just tore her apart so badly and it just makes me cringe at the thought of even trying it. I’m sure she made it seem much more dangerous for my sake, or maybe for hers, but either way I just don’t get it.\\n\\nEvery time I ask this sort of question people always shut me up saying it’s “an adult topic” and “you can’t understand it yet” which is very frustrating to me.', 't2_afca0qz7', 'Why are adults so hooked on alcohol?', 't3_14yf8vr', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/14yf8vr/why_are_adults_so_hooked_on_alcohol/'), ('14l80bn', '2023-Jun-28 07:19', 'TooAfraidToAsk', 't5_2ssp7', 'I\\'m trying to stop drinking and it feels so lame.\\n\\nI feel like everyone around me is like \"oh dang, here comes TA2556, better not offer him a drink because he\\'s a prude.\"\\n\\nAnd all the people around me who stopped drinking are constantly struggling not to.

Consuming anything right before bed isn\\'t going to help. \\n\\nWhen you\\'re drinking you want those drinking snacks (love a good burger when I\\'m drunk).

Cheers to looking good with a drink in your hand this summer!\\n\\nEdit: Well, definitely didn\\'t expect this to blow up. Figured there were a few recurring themes to address as far as replies.\\n\\nEating before bed: hey, I learned something new, and it\\'s not the bad thing I was told it was previously! Still, for me, I feel better not going to sleep bloated and I like eating early/ in the middle of the day so I can walk around and exercise. Helps me digest and get better sleep. \\n\\nModeration/ just one drink: hey, that\\'s great for you but there\\'s a difference between having a drink and drinking. There are very few people here who HAVEN\\'T struggled with moderation. I certainly have. Not really sure why, on this sub of all places the condescending attitude comes out, but it\\'s still the internet so I guess that tracks. \\n\\nYou can budget your calories! - yes, I literally say in my post \"props if you can manage it, I\\'m jealous\" so maybe the people who are managing well don\\'t need to refute a piece of advice that doesn\\'t really apply to them but does/helps others. Some real \"main character\" attitudes here. \\n\\n\\n\\nWe all know that there\\'s no one size fits all with weight loss. If something doesn\\'t apply to you, maybe just recognize that it\\'s good advice to other people and you don\\'t need to chime in/ have a verbalized opinion on everything you see. \\n\\nTo everyone who said this resonated/ it was the advice you needed to hear, much love, glad we\\'re able to support each other on this healthy life choice. \\n\\nI\\'ve lurked this sub for a while and it was a break from drinking for reasons unrelated to weight loss that helped me start the current journey I\\'m on. I drink beer which is really calorie heavy. For me, I was never going to lose the weight while drinking the way I did.

I didn\\'t drink before I was 21, but after that I wouldn\\'t drink super often, but when I would it would be a lot. Not like blackout need to go to the hospital drinking, but stay at the bar for 6 hours and have 10 light beers, definitely enough to get pretty buzzed and be hungover the next morning. But I\\'d only do it a few times/month, and honestly I\\'m completely fine with that.\\n\\nThen covid happened and bars closed, and I started drinking more at home. Usually after dinner I\\'d pick up a 6 pack, and just finish it that night while working or watching tv or playing video games whatever. Again this is over the course of a few hours, so I wasn\\'t blacking out or throwing up or anything, but I\\'d definitely have a good buzz. It started as a once/week thing, but gradually escalated to the point where now I probably average 4-5 nights/week where I do this. But it definitely rises and falls. Once in awhile I\\'ll do it 7 nights in a row, then I\\'ll be worried it\\'s too much and easily just not drink at all for a week. Earlier in the year I had a pretty bad bender where I was something like 10 nights in a row and got super worried and successfully quit for a month, again once I decided to do it it wasn\\'t even hard. But then after that month I was convinced it wasn\\'t a problem and fell right back into my old habits.\\n\\nAnd this is where I\\'m a bit confused. I\\'ve been taught from a young age that alcoholism means a physical dependence, and I just don\\'t feel that at all. I didn\\'t drink all weekend and I\\'m fine. I had a thought earlier about running to get beer and just decided no (for the same reason I\\'m making this post, I\\'m worried and trying to cut back) and it was pretty easy to do. I\\'ve even decided I was going to drink one night, the normal place I get beer was closed and I\\'d have to drive 5 minutes to the next closest one, and just decided that was too much I wouldn\\'t drink that night. It just doesn\\'t seem like something an alcoholic would do. But I also know if I don\\'t change something that after I\\'ve convinced myself it\\'s not a problem, maybe after going a full week without drinking or something, that I\\'ll voluntarily choose to drink several nights in a row again.\\n\\nAnd honestly in the short term it\\'s not affecting me at all. I have a great job and I\\'ve never even been tempted to drink during the day so it\\'s not affecting my work, I make 300k so even though I spend a pretty obscene amount on alcohol I\\'m still saving a ton of money every month and other than alcohol costs I\\'m pretty minimalist about everything else. I have a great marriage that I\\'ve been in for 3 years now and she works super early so usually is in bed way before me. I don\\'t hide the fact that I sometimes drink after she\\'s asleep and she\\'s fine with it so this isn\\'t capable of impacting our relationship, although I suspect she doesn\\'t know exactly how often I do it or she might have the same concerns about my health as I do. I\\'ve never lied or put alcohol in front of spending time with her or anything. She\\'s not a big drinker but sometimes we\\'ll have a drink or two with dinner and usually if I do that I don\\'t drink at all after that. Other relationships if anything alcohol helps, I\\'ll hang out with friends or parents occasionally at a bar or brewery and catch up with them, again I\\'m completely fine with this. My one big concern honestly is just health. I know this amount of alcohol is having an impact on my body, and the biggest roadblock to cutting back is every night I want to I just tell myself \"well one extra day doesn\\'t hurt, I\\'ll just drink tonight and not again for the next week\". But when I tell myself that several days in a row, that\\'s the issue.\\n\\nSo anyway tldr, my question is does anyone else have experience with this kind of issue, and how did you resolve it? I would be completely fine if I could cut back to 1-2 nights/week of drinking, and in theory it seems like this should be easy. I\\'m thinking of maybe just each week planning my nights I want to drink out in advance and telling myself absolutely no alcohol on other days. But I worry that I\\'ll start off adhering to it and then maybe I have a rough day at work and tell myself \"well if this week I just drink a 3rd day is that so bad?\" and it spirals from there. Does anyone have any advice dealing with this, and would speaking to a professional help with this? I honestly don\\'t really understand my motivations it\\'s almost like I\\'ll just be bored and drinking is something to do, not like I\\'m craving it if that makes sense. Am I lying to myself and the only way to cut back is to quit drinking entirely?\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nedit: Forgot to add the physical part, I actually just had bloodwork done last week and I\\'m in perfect physical health no liver damage (yet). I play on a competitive after work sports team and we practice a few nights/week and do conditioning/weight training a few nights/week as well so despite consuming a good amount of calories in beer I\\'m in pretty solid shape and right around the middle in terms of healthy weight for my height.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nedit2: holy shit this blew up, I can\\'t even read all the replies, but for a few themes:  \\n1. omg you make 300k how can you have any problems at all?  \\nEveryone has problems, I literally have a former coworker who was making millions per year with a family and kids who died of a drug overdose at 35. I wasn\\'t trying to brag about my salary if anything there are people in my field who make a lot more, I\\'ve just seen questions on reddit before about addiction and the top answers are \"add up how much you spend then you\\'ll realize how much you need to stop\". I was merely pointing out that I\\'ve actually already added it up, and I still make enough that it\\'s not a huge deal.  \\n\\n\\n  \\n2. Suggestions of non-alcoholic beer. This seems super odd to me since when I\\'m drinking I\\'m drinking to experience the feeling of getting buzzed. I do understand potentially doing it to rewire my brain to replace one habit with something similar and less harmful so I guess I\\'ll think about trying it, but it just seems a bit counterproductive. I just drink water with most meals, and on nights I don\\'t drink I generally just have my water bottle and drink water.  \\n\\n\\n  \\n3. Lots of people accusing me of justifying my addiction which is honestly what I\\'m a bit worried about. I appreciate that the comments likely come from a good place, but I have plenty of friends who drink recreationally because being buzzed is pretty enjoyable, but also control themselves much better than I can in terms of volume. I\\'m definitely questioning whether that\\'s possible for me, but I know it\\'s possible for others so I\\'m at least trying to explore if that\\'s possible for me before trying to just go completely sober. The comparisons to heroin are also pretty odd since there\\'s a pretty huge difference. No I wouldn\\'t be ok doing heroin just 1-2 times/week, but I am also ok drinking soda 1-2 times/week and I consider alcohol to be much closer to soda than heroin as long as I can control it.  \\n\\n\\n  \\n4. One really insightful theme I\\'ve gotten is thinking about why I actually drink. As I mentioned it\\'s been years since I\\'ve drank to the point of blacking out, and I\\'ve quit drinking and switched to water when I start to feel like I\\'m crossing the line from buzzed to drunk so it really is the buzzed part I\\'m apparently chasing, but I do have a history of social anxiety and definitely stress about things, and I think that goes away when I\\'m buzzed. It\\'s pretty likely I\\'m subconsciously coping with things using alcohol and that\\'s why I want to do it so much. I think I really do need to think about that and am debating whether to schedule time with a therapist.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n5. A lot of the anecdotes of \"this used to be me\" or \"you remind me of x\" really hit home, because none of them had good endings and obviously I don\\'t want that to be me. I\\'ve copied a few of those and plan to have them to read to myself when I\\'m trying to justify to myself \"just this once isn\\'t too bad\".\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAnyway I think this is going to be my plan going forward:  \\n\\\\- not drink for the rest of the month. I have a wedding the first weekend in September so I\\'m planning on that being the next time I drink.\\n\\n\\\\- Setting a hard limit after that of 1 night per week of drinking alone, and at most 2 nights per month drinking with others. If I surpass that limit and get invited to hang out, I\\'ll tell my friend in advance that I won\\'t be drinking that night, and have them hold me accountable so I don\\'t start using going out as a reason to \"just this once\" ignore my rule and go out with friends more as a loophole.\\n\\n\\\\- If I break either of those rules, I don\\'t drink for a month, and if I fail that or start spiraling, I will seek professional help and set my limit to full sober', 't2_6iil6n1n', 'Has Anyone Successfully Reduced Consumption of Alcohol without Quitting?', 't3_15qlt38', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/15qlt38/has_anyone_successfully_reduced_consumption_of/'), ('14c4u4l', '2023-Jun-17 18:15', 'AskReddit', 't5_2qh1i', '', 't2_nemy68bh', 'What is an alternative to things like drugs, sex and alcohol that can give you the same thrill, excitement, adrenaline and euphoria that those things can give?', 't3_14c4u4l', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/14c4u4l/what_is_an_alternative_to_things_like_drugs_sex/'), ('16242sc', '2023-Aug-26 14:22', 'tooktoomuch', 't5_38aq5', 'This was a pretty popular post a while back on the forum, highlighting the harm that alcohol can do to us.

It's been long overtime hours  for a while to prep for when my wife needs to stop work closer to due  date, so I just wanted 2. Later we were cuddling in bed and started  making out, and after a bit I tried to go all the way with her and she  immediately got mad. I was confused and asked her what was wrong, and  she was getting all cranky and saying how I didn’t even care if it would  hurt the baby. I was confused and thought she meant that the baby could  be poked and I tried to explain that the baby would be totally safe and  I wouldn’t ever want to hurt our baby. She got even madder and she  started talking about fetal alcohol syndrome.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShe  was saying how if I finished then the baby could take the alcohol and  get fetal alcohol syndrome in her. I was so flabbergasted because that’s  definitely not how it works, and I even looked it up later to be sure  that I wasn’t just stupid. But she said it would happen like that, and I  tried to soothe her that it wasn’t the case- I think now I should have  said that it would be okay to not do it anyway if she was worried  because I don’t want her stressing and the baby, but I didn’t think of  that then and tried to softly argue about me not able to get the baby  hurt like that and she might have thought it was just me trying to get  laid even though I was soft about it. She started crying about how I  don’t care at all again and I tried to hug her and she pushed me away  and cried some more. I apologized a bunch and offered to show her proof  online to calm her and she just locked herself in the bathroom. I tried  to sorry through the door but she wasn’t having it and I eventually went  to bed by myself alone and slept hardly a little\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSaturday  morning she was in bed and red from crying so I hugged her and it was  okay again for a bit. I tried to softly talk about it again because I  don’t want her thinking I'd endanger our baby but she got upset and I  admit I kept talking. I was confused she was never like this ever  before, and usually if I softly talk about it and listen to her all the  way and don’t make her feel silly then she listens to me all the way too  and we solve it. I don’t think we even have a fight before. But I  though it would be like before and she says I’m not educated enough to  know the truth because I work in a awarehouse, and I admit it upset me.  She was grown up sheltered and that's why doesn't know but I would NEVER  say that to hurt her and I’m hurt she’d say that. I said does she  really want not want to talk about it and she said an emphetic YES. So  I’ve been giving room and she keeps crying quietly on other parts of the  house.I’m worried now she’s mad for me not going to college. It’s quiet  right now here.

I’m currently planning the reception and I have already secured a venue. I was having a discussion with my fiancé (27F) about possible food options (catering or cooking, what types of food, buffet style or served, etc.) and my mother (60F) and one of my aunts (56F) were visiting. They threw in some thoughts and advice, as they’ve had weddings, which I really appreciate. The topic of drinking came up, and my aunt asked what kind of cocktails we’d be serving. I told her we wouldn’t be serving alcohol at the wedding. She was shocked and asked what everyone was going to drink. I told her there would be water, sweet tea, lemonade, fruit-punch, and soda available.\\n\\nMy aunt said that having soda was a bad idea because it’s so unhealthy, and so is sweet tea and overly sugary lemonade and fruit-punch. I told her if was so concerned about sugar content she could stick with water, and we’re planning on having plenty of fresh fruit she could add to it. We’d also have unsweet tea for my diabetic family members, or they’re welcome to request or bring a desirable alternative. She asked why alcohol couldn’t be a request. I told her I simply didn’t want to serve any at my wedding. My fiancé and I would be financially responsible for the purchase (and alcohol would frankly be out of our budget) and we would feel responsible for their actions. She asked if she and the other drinkers of the family could bring their own beer and said it really wouldn’t be a party without one. I said no, again, because it’s my wedding and fiancé and I would feel responsible for drunk guests. We also want to have a wedding that’s fun and happy because everyone there loves each other and is happy to celebrate their family/our union.\\n\\nShe said it was already a shame I wasn’t getting married in a church and the least I could do was make up for it with a good reception. I told her if she can’t go one evening without drinking then maybe she’s the one with a problem. At this point my mom jumped in and told me I need to apologize, I said no, I don’t appreciate how my aunt has spoken to me and she needs to leave. They ended up going, but then my aunt complained the next day on Facebook about my “dry wedding” and said she wasn’t going to torture herself driving an hour and a half to my venue just to have a bad time. She also explained how the conversation went the day before and said I called her a drunk for being healthy. I’ve been getting a lot of messages, some supportive, some on the fence, and some very angry that I want to “ruin a good reception by acting like it’s the prohibition era”. I’m honestly confused here, am I the asshole?\\n\\nEdit: my aunt’s health comment wasn’t about beer, it was about wine. She believes a glass a day is important for maintaining health and she drinks at least one glass every single day. She’s also hopped on the intermittent fasting trend, so I take her “health advice” with a grain of salt. Especially since she probably meets the medical threshold for alcoholism. \\n\\nAlso, another reason I don’t want alcohol is because this is a specifically kid friendly event. I want my little cousins and nieces/nephews and my fiancé’s younger family members to be able to attend. I don’t feel comfortable hosting an all-ages event with lots of alcohol and drunk adults present. A lot of my family members do not behave when they’re drunk.\\n\\nEDIT 2: For those saying I should make the “dry” part clear in advance, I planned on having the entire food and drink situation for the wedding figured out and announced six months before the date. I wasn’t going to spring it on people last minute. Everyone was going to be informed and then further reminded on the Save-The-Date’s and the invites! I’m also not anti-alcohol or something. I like drinking, there are just too many concerning factors and liabilities with allowing it at my wedding, including the incredibly expensive cost of providing the alcohol.\\n\\nEdit 3: To everyone suggesting a cash bar, that would invariably make this situation worse. My relatives expect me to provide alcohol for free. If I tell them they have to pay they will complain more. One of my uncles was arrested last year because the price of his favorite brand of beer went up and he stole his next 12-pack because “he deserved it after how much money he gave to that company”. He still thinks the cops and the store were in the wrong.\\n\\nEdit 4: Very tired of people not reading or simply ignoring what I’ve already made clear and twisting my words. I’ve explained my case.

This has been going on as long as I can remember. He is destitute, malnourished and has advanced ARD (alcohol related dementia) which is worse when he doesn’t drink. He can’t work, drive or care for himself in any meaningful way. I’ve been there for all of it while my siblings left a long time ago and have done nothing other than an occasional check.\\n\\nMy sister arranged for him to be put in a long term care facility (she was not paying for it, state funded) fairly close to me. He was “sober” but was caught several times stealing alcohol wipes to either suck on them. I visited him twice and it was like a horror show, I didn’t realize places like this existed outside of the movies. During one of his coherent moments he begged me to take him out. I told him the second he had access to alcohol he’ll drink again. He said he knew but he’s ready to die and he’s at peace with it.\\n\\nI talked it over with my husband and we hired a specialist to examine my dad and he said if he drinks he has maybe 6 months left.

He’s not stealing to fund his habit, he’s not bothering the public and he won’t get arrested. \\n\\nMy siblings think that he was going to get better in the facility and think Ive signed him up for a death sentence. I told them that they are welcome to move him to a facility closer to them so they can be the ones to visit him and see his food covered in roaches and his baths being wiped down with chemicals.

We will only be serving non-alcoholic options and there won't be any available for people to people to buy at the 'bar'.\\n\\nI'm a recovering alcoholic (sober 4 years 7 months) but if I'm out socially and a discussion about having alcohol comes up, I always lie and tell people I'm seriously intolerant to alcohol and it makes me very sick.

Only my best friends and immediate family know (and my fiance obviously).\\n\\nJames' birthday was in early April and we rented the room above a pub (yep, big fun for the recovering alcoholic as you can imagine..!) to celebrate. Convos about our wedding came up and I don't remember exactly how but I ended up talking to a group of not-so-close friends (more James' friends and my acquaintances) about the wedding. I said it was going to be an alcohol free wedding and they were pretty incredulous. Especially as James' birthday was not alcohol free. They asked why and I said I wasn't giving a reason, there's just no alcohol. They asked if I was pregnant, I said no. I just don't want alcohol at my wedding.\\n\\nI was called a buzzkill and told that people go to weddings to drink, that it's polite to put money behind the bar for your guests particularly if they are evening guests. It ended up in this big debate about drinking at weddings. One of our much closer friends joined the convo and asked why I didn't just tell them all why I don't drink. I said it was none of their business, pretty rudely to be honest but I was getting pissed off at this point. One of James' friends said being honest about it was the least I could do and it was wrong of me not to at least explain myself. One of them also made a fairly unpleasant joke at my expense basically suggesting I'm the 'ball and chain' now for James.\\n\\nI took myself out of the conversation because I was upset but I still don't think I owe anyone an explanation despite what they say.

We didn't put it on the invites because BYOB isn't really a thing here with these kinds of venues, so we figured people won't (if they do I can't stop them drinking it but I'd rather they didn't) however if we put that it's a dry wedding more people will try and bring their own. And we because we've told the venue there's no alcohol, we have to pay a very steep corkage fee if people bring it and the venue staff notice. So we'd have to pay a considerable amount if someone was really obvious about it, and we all know drunk people aren't great at secrecy!\\n\\nEdit: all of my comments are being downvoted (so I guess I know how this judgement will go!) so I'm not sure if people will see my comment below on this, but I think I'm just going to mass email our guests telling the truth. It makes me feel awful to tell people I'm an alcoholic, but then I can say that it's a dry wedding and ask them not to bring alcohol, then the bandage is off and if they judge me they judge me.

We went with my dad and his fiancé (one of my sisters being her daughter). A few months prior to this, my uncle asked me to be the photographer at his wedding as i had done it as a qualification. (me being the photographer is kind of relevant). \\n\\nDuring the wedding i made sure to only consume a little alcohol. not even enough for a buzz. so during the dinner i was completely sober. my dad and his fiancé however, we’re completely wasted. realistically speaking, i was the only sober person there (legal age to drink in the UK is 18). \\n\\nMy dads fiancé kept allowing my 14 year old sister to drink. At one point me and my little sister (17) told her to stop drinking because she kept staggering by the pool and we didn’t want her to hurt herself. however my dads very drunk fiancé kept insisting that she was fine and she could have more. \\n\\nNow in the last year, i’ve personally had really bad experiences whilst drinking, i wont bore you with the details but both included very drunk men and one even included the police. I’m very cautious of my little sisters safety due to this as even though they have people around them to protect them (as did i at the time) something may still happen. \\n\\nTowards the end of the night my dads fiancé told my little sister she could get another drink and i exploded a little. saying things like “that’s your last one” and “we aren’t responsible for what happens to you if you carry on”. My dads fiancé turned around and basically said i wasn’t her mother. I’m fully aware of this fact. however being the only sober adult at the table, i was trying to make sure everyone was safe and my 14 year old sister was at a point where if she walked off alone she wouldn’t be. \\n\\nI then turned around to my dads fiancé and said “respectfully i love you and i appreciate everything you’ve done for me, my sisters and my dad but neither are you”. \\n\\nHer parents pulled me aside after this and told me that they agreed and i later found out from my uncle (the groom) that he agreed and he felt that my dad and his fiancé were forgetting how old my sister is. \\n\\nMy dad, 17 year old sister and step mum all expected me to give an apology, however everyone else who attended the wedding agreed with what i had said. \\n\\nSo AITA for telling my dads fiancé the truth even though it probably hurt her?\\n\\nquick edit: me and my dad are now on speaking terms as father’s day just passed and i was the only one of his kids who got him something. i still haven’t spoken to my dads fiancé and actually just missed my dads weekend to have us because i covered someone’s shift at work. i’ve also spoken to my sister (17) and she understands why i did what i did.\\n\\nanother edit: i’m reading all the comments, first of all thank you everyone who has left one. i’m so happy even some of you are sharing your own stories. second, to the few people who have said that i’m a good older sister, it’s really warming my heart. thank you so much.\\n\\nok final update: me and my sisters (17 &amp; 14) are from my mum and dad. my dads fiancé is our step mum. my 15 year old sister is my step mums daughter from her previous marriage. i hope that clears some thing up', 't2_p37fci83', 'AITA for telling my dads fiancé that she isn’t our parent?

It seems my SiL is very upset because of me, because she thinks I was cheap when they came all the way to see us and bring gifts for our baby.\\nTo be clear, my husband was the one who planned the second party, and he bought sodas and juices because that's what he wanted to buy, I don't know why I'm being blamed.\\n\\nThe thing is, not serving alcohol for a party IS rare and kinda weird here, but my family didn't say anything about it, so we just went with the same plan for the second party..\\n\\nAnd before anyone says anything about my husband, he called his mom and asked what the hell was going on, and said if they're not happy with our way of hosting, they don't have to come next time.\\n\\nI guess I'm asking if we are the a**hole because it seems extreme to not have them over again for such a small issue, we can just buy alcohol next time.\\n\\nEDIT : There are a lot more comments than what I thought, thank you all for your judgement for such a small issue.\\n\\nTo answer the most frequent questions : we're French, they were expecting wine with the meal and champagne with the cake, and it was lunch and the afternoon after that, they left around 6PM.\\n\\nHusband is still super mad at them, but as far as I'm concerned, the issue is solved.

This is the third highest cause of death in America. 1st is tobacco, 2nd is poor diet and exercise habits. It causes more deaths than all other drugs combined. \\n\\n2. It’s one of the only drugs and by far the most mainstream that actually causes you to be violent, and is a factor in large amounts of violent crime/ domestic abuse. \\n\\n3. The life expectancy of someone hospitalized with an alcohol problem is about 50. Almost 30 years shorter than the average life expectancy in America. \\n\\n4. 28% of driving deaths in America are caused by alcohol. \\n\\n5. It’s the only drug that has withdrawals that can actually kill you. \\n\\nThere are many more reasons that I have but those are statistically backed and not opinionated. It’s dangerous and absolutely terrible for you. The only positive it provides is more fun social interactions, which literally any drug used in moderation can provide, the difference being that it’s not taboo to drink a beer or 2, while it’s taboo to casually do some heroin. \\n\\nAlso, who likes being hungover?\\n\\nWorth noting you can make most of the same arguments for tobacco, but in my experiences tobacco is typically more frowned upon than drinking.\\n\\nEdit: I understand that prohibition didn’t work. I’m not saying alcohol being illegal is feasible. I’m just saying that I don’t think it should be legal. Plenty of other drugs are illegal and people don’t throw a fit\\n\\nEdit 2: Y’all are bringing up good points and counterpoints but it’s too much stuff for me to reply to. The war on drugs and prohibition are great reasons as to why this won’t work. Don’t have much of an argument there. \\n\\nI’m not totally opposed to the idea of all drugs being legal and providing medical care and safe spaces for addicts. This has worked in other places around the world but the American health system is so screwed up that it would still just fuck people over. Mainly just because it’s so for profit and unaffordable for so many people that I don’t think this would help anybody. That is an issue with medical system as a whole and not with the idea of drugs being legal. \\n\\nI’m seeing people bring up caffeine and sugar. People really need to educate themselves on the negative effects of both of those drugs. The long terms effects of those are silent killers, mainly sugar. It’s pretty unavoidable and not terrible in moderation the typical American diet has wayyyyyy too much sugar for anybody to consume healthily.\\n\\nEdit 3: a point I failed to make is that alcohol is way more dangerous than other illegal drugs, mainly weed and psychedelics. I don’t smoke weed myself but there’s no denying that it causes way less harm than alcohol, both in society and to your body.\\n\\nEdit 4: damn y’all are salty.

But Rick said that he liked it but felt the food was missing something, and asked how much garlic I used.\\n\\nI said I don’t eat garlic, so I didn’t include it.\\n\\nHe scoffed and was like “How can you not use the most basic ingredient to most meals? That’s why it tastes like this.” He made a big exaggerated face and put the food down.\\n\\nHe then asked why I’d have a dinner party if I had such a limited palate and that he wouldn’t have people over for thanksgiving dinner if he was a vegetarian. \\n\\nI said “I have GERD, dude, garlic triggers it.”\\n\\nHe pointed out that I was drinking alcohol.\\n\\nI said yes, I was in fact drinking one hard seltzer that I had flattened, and that these are the only alcoholic beverage I can drink. And that I was also having one just in case my body changes its mind.\\n\\nHe and I went back and forth until his girlfriend (the one who is actually my friend) told him to chill. Rick got kind of louder and was laughing like “Come on guys, am I really the asshole here?” with his hands out.\\n\\nOne of the other guys said that it was a little weird but not a big deal.\\n\\nAnyway it’s a month later and Rick still won’t drop it. He keeps insisting that it was a douchey/selfish hosting move to drink the alcohol but not cook with the garlic, because garlic goes in everything.\\n\\nSo now I’m curious and thought this would be a fun low-stakes question for you all.\\n\\nAm I the asshole?', 't2_rnani1l5', 'AITA for having a dinner party and not using garlic for the food while still drinking alcohol?', 't3_wrnmlw', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/wrnmlw/aita_for_having_a_dinner_party_and_not_using/'), ('wzv9gb', '2022-Aug-28 08:16', 'Futurology', 't5_2t7no', '', 't2_41v32', 'Psychedelic ‘Magic Mushroom’ Ingredient Could Help Treat Alcohol Addiction', 't3_wzv9gb', 'https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/psychedelic-magic-mushroom-ingredient-could-help-treat-alcohol-addiction-180980658/'), ('vyubcq', '2022-Jul-14 07:07', 'confidentlyincorrect', 't5_2cn1kk', '', 't2_2leuniv4', 'Alcohol is sexy, Marijuana is deadly', 't3_vyubcq', 'https://i.redd.it/shiism5cyib91.jpg'), ('yme8lh', '2022-Nov-04 18:46', 'perfectlycutscreams', 't5_3n7fs', '', 't2_ac0qh06v', 'pure alcohol drinking', 't3_yme8lh', 'https://v.redd.it/h1s6v7svt0y91'), ('rpu9ac', '2021-Dec-27 12:48', 'LifeProTips', 't5_2s5oq', \"The major reason for nausea and hang-over effects from drinking is dehydration.

Do not comment on the original post or DM OOP. \\n\\n**Trigger Warnings:** &gt;!alcoholism!&lt;\\n\\n**Mood Spoiler:** &gt;!tentatively hopeful!&lt;\\n\\n**Original** Post(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ubfdx/aita_for_throwing_my_brothers_alcoholism_back_in/)**: April 21, 2023**\\n\\nFor context: I (20F) in the US where the drinking age is 21.\\n\\nBoth of my parents died by the time I was 10. My older brother, Charlie (then 19, now 29), ghosted. He was an alcoholic and felt it was all too much. It’s a choice I now understand as an adult, but as a kid, of course it hurt. I was raised by both my grandmother and older sister, Renee (then 17, now 27). My grandmother did all she could, but she was older and relied on Renee a lot.\\n\\nWhen I was 17, Charlie came back into our lives, 2 years sober. Renee and I forgave him. I am now very close to him and we’ve bonded a lot. I actually live with him now while I go to college because he lives literally right up the road.\\n\\nI do party on occasion, but it’s very rare I get drunk. Now, I always assumed that Charlie knew I drank. I’m in college. Not every college student parties, but when I’m at out past midnight, I figure it’s obvious I’m not playing Scrabble or whatever.\\n\\nI crashed at a friend’s on Wednesday night after having a bit too much to drink. I returned to Charlie’s, hungover. It wasn’t quite obvious at first but then I started throwing up. He figured it out and began lecturing me. Said I’m 20, not legally able to drink, it’s not safe to get wasted at a college party. Told me that I shouldn’t drink at all at my age. He wasn’t yelling, more matter of fact than anything.\\n\\nI wasn’t feeling great, had a headache and found his rant hypocritical. I told him such. He started drinking at 15, had a huge problem at 19. He abandoned our family when we needed him most. He has no right to judge me or act like a protective big brother now. Charlie got quiet, walked out of the room and later left for work. He hasn’t said much to me since. He’s definitely not mad, just sad and hurt.\\n\\nRenee told me I crossed a line. While she’s fine with me drinking and thinks Charlie overreacted a little, she said I went way too far in throwing back all that in his face. Especially as I’ve never brought it up before. She says the most I should’ve said was that I was safe while drinking and I understood his concern, but I could do what I wanted as an adult.\\n\\nI’m starting to feel bad. Was I wrong?\\n\\n***Relevant Comments:***\\n\\n*Someone points out brother may have been worried for her safety:*\\n\\n\"I didn’t consider that he was worried about me being vulnerable around guys. I just thought he was talking about driving, which I didn’t do. I walked to a friend’s dorm.\"\\n\\n*You share a genetic predisposition for alcoholism:* \\n\\n\"While I don’t think I have a problem, our mom was a heroin addict and it contributed to her death. Her mom was an alcoholic. Pretty sure her sister was too. So, it is genetic. Doesn’t mean I have it, but the commenter and my brother aren’t wrong to be concerned, I’m learning.\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, I didn’t know much about the genetic part but when you said it and I look at our family history…you’re not far off. I don’t think I have a problem but it certainly is genetic in our family.\"\\n\\n*Many people point out just how much OOP overreacted:* \\n\\n\"You’re absolutely right. I’m definitely becoming embarrassed.\"\\n\\n*It wasn\\'t your brother\\'s responsibility to care for you:*\\n\\n\"I don’t think he had a responsibility to take care of anyone. I do think he had a responsibility to just not up and leave. So maybe people are right. Maybe I am not really over it.\"\\n\\n\"I’ve thought about therapy a lot. I guess it’s time to think about it more.\"\\n\\n***OOP is voted YTA***\\n\\n**Update (Same Post): April 22, 2023 (Next Day)**\\n\\nUpdate: First of all, thank you for being so honest with me. A lot of it was very hard to read and I didn’t want to accept it, but I know I needed to.\\n\\nI still do not think I have a drinking problem. I know that’s what every alcoholic says, but I truly do not get as drunk as I did that often. At the same time, I recgonize addiction is genetic and Charlie is not the only person in our family that struggles with it. Considering that, I am going to take a break from drinking for a little while and if/when I start again in the future (after I turn 21 at a minimum), I will be more careful when it comes to how much I consume and the venue in which I consume it.\\n\\nA lot of you pointed out that Charlie was right about the safety concern. I was getting wasted at a college party. I didn’t include this in the post, which is unfair looking back as it’s important context, but none of my friends were sober either. So, I had no one looking out for me nor was I looking out for myself. I see now all the things that could’ve happened.\\n\\nThe big takeaway is that I am not “okay” or “over” with what happened. I buried it down because I just wanted a relationship with my brother again and then as soon as I was reminded of that time, I lashed out. I plan to look into finding a therapist because clearly, there’s a lot of unresolved issues.\\n\\nFinally, I knew early on after posting that I owed Charlie an apology. I ordered dinner for us last night and apologized. I said I understood that he was concerned and he had every right to be. I also said I had no right to throw everything back in his face. Charlie apologized for everything he put the family through, but I told him that he already had. He repeated that he was just very worried about me turning into him. I thanked him for his concern and told him I’m grateful for him, I love him.\\n\\nI am not foolish to think everything is okay. He knows now that I’m struggling with everything. I also can’t take back the words I said or what a brat I was. But we’re going to try moving forward and find healing.\\n\\n**If you\\'re in the US and need help with substance abuse, check out this** link(https://www.samhsa.gov/find-help/national-helpline) **for resources.**', 't2_51nvnr4', 'AITA for throwing my brother’s alcoholism back in his face when he expressed concern about me drinking?', 't3_132jg4c', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/132jg4c/aita_for_throwing_my_brothers_alcoholism_back_in/'), ('15glwkk', '2023-Aug-02 17:21', 'baseball', 't5_2qm7u', '', 't2_12idxk', 'Nightengale Yankees starter Domingo German goes on the restricted list for alcohol abuse.

The idea came from the saying *\"it takes 21 days to make a habit.\"* This has been de-bunked, with the research showing it takes 66 days to make a habit, and 254 days to make a lifestyle change. Either way, I thought it would be helpful to self-reflect every 3 weeks to see if I have vices ingrained as habits.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n* **No Alcohol (Day 57):** This feels almost second nature, and I do not miss drinking. I use to have a glass of red wine almost daily. Now, the idea of drinking wine feels *\"strange.\"* I just don\\'t want it. EXCEPT WHEN I AM BORED! So, I\\'m learning that building my routine is critical.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n* **No Marijuana (Day 39)** This one still continues to be a struggle. It\\'s significantly easier than the first 21 days, but I still find myself thinking about edibles daily. The couch-locked lifestyle has been ingrained since the pandemic. Even without edibles, I find myself in front of the TV. Then, I get antsy and anxious for not being more productive. This is why building a routine is critical. Cravings are still intense on my low days. Writing posts about the journey helps. This one is still the hardest of all of my challenges.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n* **No Eating out/Restaurants (Day 21):** ***(with exceptions)*** I\\'ve saved A LOT of money here. However, in week one, I quickly learned that there is a difference between making a goal to not eat take out, and making a goal to eat healthy. My first week was full of grilled cheese, cereal, and other foods that took me back to my college days. Week 2 incorporated healthier food, however I wasn\\'t eating some produce, so things went bad. By week 3, I learned to be honest with myself regarding things I will eat/not eat, and shop accordingly. I\\'m learning to give myself grace, play around with recipes, and just be proud I am making healthier choices in small amounts every day.\\n\\n*EXCEPTION-intentional socializing:* I decided intentional socializing is an exception to my rule. I had brunch with my friend of over 20 years yesterday. Our lives took very different paths, but we usually mange to connect every 9-12 months for a dinner and catch up. Additionally, free food (i.e. things from work) are also exceptions. Food just shows up in social settings, and I\\'m in no position to starve myself of social interactions.  *(no pun intended)*\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n* **Walking (running) 3 miles a day (Day 13):**   I started this challenge early because of the marijuana anxiety. What started off as walking 3 miles, slowly turned into challenging myself to run a bit on each walk.\\n\\nBefore my mental health really fell apart, I was a marathon runner. I stopped running consistently around the height of the pandemic. Plus, a break-up with another runner really solidified my running aversion. However, I\\'m slowly running again by challenging myself to run a bit further during each walk. I give myself grace, because I used to run 12 miles in the morning without giving it a second thought. Now, I reward myself for making it past a mile. Challenging myself to do more than yesterday makes it fun.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n* **Motivation:** The day-counting widget on my phone has been very helpful, particularly for marijuana. Each time I think about having an edible, I see the days of sobriety. I think to myself *\"Is an edible now worth breaking 30-something days of sobriety?\"* I\\'m used to going for instant gratification, so the delay is a change. Another motivation are some people I met recently. I don\\'t know if they are sober or not, but I\\'m aware of the type of person I want to be in their presence, and I want to be sober. Lastly, I love writing update posts. I don\\'t know if they are helpful to anyone out there, but believing they are is motivating.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n* **Next challenge options:**\\n\\n1. no coffee\\n2. no social media (aside from LinkedIn and this sub-reddit.)\\n3. journal every day.\\n\\nI think I\\'m going to ride out my walk/run challenge, before I decide which of the above options will be the next to tackle. I\\'m sure all three will eventually be in the mix over the course of this experiment.\\n\\nOverall, incredibly fun challenge. If you try it, be warned you learn things about yourself the more you remove things you don\\'t need. You become unable to escape yourself. Have a therapist handy.\\n\\nThanks if you made it to the end and hanging out on this journey. Good luck on your adulting goals this week!\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;', 't2_6f6twbsc2', 'Update: 57 days without alcohol, 39 days without marijuana, and such.', 't3_1521s6a', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1521s6a/update_57_days_without_alcohol_39_days_without/'), ('14tqo66', '2023-Jul-07 21:07', 'todayilearned', 't5_2qqjc', '', 't2_ltu8vtr7', 'TIL During the shooting event of the 1965 World Pentathlon Championships, Herbert Polzhuber drank 10 glasses of beer and a bottle of cognac, stepped onto the shooting platform, shot all his bullets directly into the ground and passed out.

These guys are both fuckwits and animal hoarders. One of their dogs \\'ticks\\' was that it could drink a half bottle of wine (350mls, \\\\~12.5US fluid ounces, of 11% alc/vol). They wouldn\\'t feed him until he completed this \\'trick\\', which he must do twice a day, and is repeated everyday. They think it\\'s a great laugh... I think it\\'s cruel as fuck. They are getting sick of him though because now he no longer staggers around after consuming the alcohol and said that they are think about getting rid of him (which means a bullet in these parts). I offered to take him, and they accepted.\\n\\nProblem is, the dog seems to go absolutely berserk, and then looks in pain, before staggering around in fright if I don\\'t give him a small glass (100mls) of wine. Before I realised this, I opened a bottle of wine myself and took a swig, and he leapt up on me desperately licking my lips and sticking his tongue in my mouth... I didn\\'t know if it was a physiological or psychological dependence.\\n\\nI\\'ve taken him to my vet (whom estimated his age at 6 years old), who has said this is a rather unusual situation and alcoholism treatment hasn\\'t been studied widely in dogs, but this dog is likely physically dependent on alcohol and he\\'s going through the \"DT\\'s\" just like human alcoholics do when they are cut off from alcohol \\'cold turkey\\'.\\n\\nMy vet said he couldn\\'t professionally recommend I keep giving the dog alcohol, nor could he think of a specialist that could help. Off the record he suggested that I wean the dog down, 50mls a week until his consumption is at 100mls a day, then down by 10mls a day, until 10mls. At 10mls to reduce it 1 ml a day every 2-3 days. He also \\'off the record\\' suggested to be flexible, to put up with \\'whining\\' for more, but if he shows withdrawal symptoms to give a little more if it helps, but to be careful not to teach the dog the \\'trick\\' of acting in withdrawal just to get more wine.\\n\\nI really want to help this guy, as he is amazingly sweet. I find it sickening that whenever my hands go above roughly my shoulder height he covers (I\\'m thinking he\\'s been hit a lot maybe?) and he freaks out at the sight of a rolled up newspaper... poor boy.\\n\\nI know it\\'s a long shot, but what do you recommend? The vet said that he would consider giving valium as that may ease withdrawals, but as that isn\\'t safe to mix with alcohol I have to decide whether I\\'m going to give him valium and promise no alcohol, or just wean him down on alcohol slowly.\\n\\nI already own a boxer (probably not pure though), and as this guy seems to be a red-heeler crossed with a boxer, he and my other dog are getting on like a house on fire! It\\'s so great to watch them both play and be so happy! That is, until my poor new boy needs another drink and becomes so anxious and pained :-/\\n\\nAny advice? I feel quite unsure of what the best way to rehab him is, and am worried that general veterinary principles (i.e. \"never give your dog alcohol) might interfere with whats best in this extremely nuanced situation. I feel like it\\'s so unfair this guy is suffering because of being made to do \\'party tricks\\' when he is so affectionate, and somehow even still has a spark in his eye and hasn\\'t just shut off to the world despite how cruel the hand he was dealt has been...\\n\\nEDIT: I\\'ve added some pics\\n\\n(Removed for fear of doxxing, given I got an abusive/treatening call from relatives, it seems the police have acted!)\\n\\n**EDIT 2:** I have called the police. Despite the fact they aren\\'t proactive, I had taken photos of an active amateur meth lab and firearms that were neither being stored correctly, and likely not owned by someone with relevant paperwork. THIS may be investigated, remembering it\\'s a \\'fly-in fly-out\\' community, or a \\\\~40 hour return trip from nearest police OUTPOST, and longer from proper police station. The settlement may have already had a visit from the police, or if they haven\\'t they may have soon. Hopefully it\\'s the proper police and not the \\'tribal justice\\' administration that has no real power OR interest in these sorts of things. One of the people involved in \\'training\\' the dog to do the trick is a retired member.\\n\\n**UPDATE:**\\n\\nHave spoken to my vet friend, who has discussed it with another vet. They have decided that despite the law, given the unique circumstances, the are confident despite statute that an alcoholic wean wouldn\\'t be considered abuse. I am going to wean him down at a rate slightly quicker than the one originally suggested (in the post), but be monitoring him constantly for signs that he is in withdrawal, in which case I\\'ll let him have a small amount and re-assess in 45 minutes. I also have some IM Valium that I\\'m to give him if he has a seizure, before immediately transporting him to the hospital. The vet will look him over twice a week at his clinic, monitoring his weight and have another liver test done in a few weeks!\\n\\nIt seems police have acted, as I received a call from one of said relatives (whom live nextdoor) shouting about police being there etc. and hanging up. I blocked their number.Thank you all for you kind comments and advice. I will update you guys in a couple of weeks to let you know how it\\'s going!\\n\\n**EDIT TO ADD TO UPDATE:** He\\'s been switched to cheap cider, from wine, which he wasn\\'t sure of at first, but after he realised it was alcoholic (about after 15 minutes I\\'d coaxed him to have some when he was starting to get agitated and restless) he then wanted more. Makes me really think it\\'s not a \\'taste\\' thing at all, he just has become so dependent he needs the alcohol in him to feel \\'normal\\'... poor guy.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n**UPDATE - 1: Alcoholic Dog’s Recovery Is Going Well!**(https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/937y0b/update_alcoholic_dogs_recovery_is_going_well/) \\\\- 31st July 2018\\n\\nPhoto of him today(https://imgur.com/FiAnkWN)\\n\\nThe treatment is going fantastically!!! From originally having 750mls of 11.5% wine a day, my new doggo only needs 200mls of 7.9% apple cider (50mls 4 times a day). This dose is enough to keep him happy, follow me around and jump around playing with my other dog, to enjoying laying on my legs, under the covers on my bed, and just doing everything that a happy dog does. He has MAJOR anxiety issues if he can’t be with me or my partner, for example just going to the shop for 2 minutes and leaving him in the yard or inside (his pick) I will come home to him whimpering and barking in a distressed manner, only to then have him to try and lick my face off when he finds I’ve returned!\\n\\nJust before the time of his next dose, he often slows down and shows some signs of agitation (i.e. increased pulse rate, not interested in playing or food) but once he’s had the next ‘dose’ of cider he picks back up again fairly quickly. Despite the taper going quicker than originally it was thought he would need, there has been no signs of the SERIOUS withdrawal symptoms. Because of his livers state, we want him to be off alcohol as quick as possible (without causing more than mild withdrawal) and thus are very pleased. The vet today considers it safe for him to take a small dose of valium, to be given ‘in between’ his drinks, 4 times a day. This should help with his agitation etc.\\n\\nI’m so hopeful that this will work out, because he’s fitted in with our family and other pets (indoors we have 2 cats and 1 dog) perfectly and is such a sweet guy. We’ve already bonded so closely, it’s a perfect match!\\n\\nThe plan from here is to try and get him down to a very low intake (60mls of 7.9% apple cider per day, given in 4 doses) within 2 weeks, and then decrease at a slower rather (1ml to 2mls per day) as often in alcoholics they can wean down to low doses without TOO much trouble from withdrawals, but ‘jumping off’ is very hard to achieve without severe withdrawals. During this time his valium dose may be increased to help with what he’s going through inside.\\n\\nI\\'m just so glad things seem to be going so well, and that he seems so happy. His temperment also has made him slot in with our existing dog and 2 cats nicely.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n**UPDATE - 2: My Alcoholic Dog\\'s Recovery: 1st Day Sober!**(https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/95bbd9/update_my_alcoholic_dogs_recovery_1st_day_sober/) \\\\- 7th August 2018\\n\\n*Click on the link to read the whole post, TL;DR added below to reduce the length of the post.*\\n\\nI am posting here to let you know that today ‘Digger’ (Doggo\\'s new name) has successfully gone 24 hours without consuming any alcohol, and seems to be fine… not quite as ‘chipper’ as usual, but certainly not suffering as much as one may expect. As you can see from these photo\\'s he may look a little sorry for himself but still can give a smile and a yawn when woken up with a belly rub!\\n\\n1. https://imgur.com/jWicRMM(https://imgur.com/jWicRMM) 2) https://imgur.com/biiC2PD(https://imgur.com/biiC2PD)\\n\\n***TL;DR:*** *Digger has successfully gone for 24 hours without alcohol, is showing no serious complications related to withdrawal, and is on meds that seem to be controlling his symptoms well enough! Although he has some temporary liver impairment, he is expected to make a full recovery, and therefore today marks the first day of the rest of his new, SOBER, life as this man\\'s best friend!*\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n**UPDATE - 3: Digger (the former Alcoholic Dog) has been alcohol free for 14 days now, and off all medication for 3 days!**(https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/994frn/update_digger_the_former_alcoholic_dog_has_been/) \\\\- 21st August 2018\\n\\nFirstly, I’m sorry I haven’t updated for a while. I’ve been unwell lately so having quite a bit of bed rest… however Digger has been loyally keeping me company, and I’ve pushed myself to make sure he gets plenty of stimulation from walks and such when he feels able to!\\n\\nThe Update (Good News Folks!):\\n\\nWell, let me preface this by saying that Digger has been progressing excellently. The first 3-4 days without alcohol (and tapering down his Valium) were fairly rough on him, and he was obviously feeling uncomfortable and unhappy, but after 5 days when I offered him a leash he EXCITEDLY jumped up to go on the walk (the first time since he’s been alcohol free). I walked him to the dog park, where he even did some off leash RUNNING (just with myself and my other dog Chester, whom while normally will play fairly rough has sensed Digger has been hurting and thus has been gentle). However, he and Chester have been playing in their normal ‘spirited’ fashion again and it seems that Digger is completely over any withdrawal symptoms… I simply cannot believe this dog is no completely chemical free after being given so much artificial stuff (first by his owners abusing him, and then secondly by me trying to help him)… he’s coped remarkably well with the treatment, and to think that a number of vets suggested he be put to sleep!\\n\\nJust to show what I mean about Digger being a happy boy, here is an album of 4 photo’s of him I took just now! https://imgur.com/a/fSCogqc(https://imgur.com/a/fSCogqc)\\n\\nThe last photo is a bit soppy, but he’s so sweet… always wanting to lick my face. Funnily enough, after my girl and I have been kissing, he often comes up and starts wanting to lick my face as though he thinks that that is just how we say ‘hello’ around here! Sometimes no matter how much I try and protest he won’t settle till he atleast gets the tip of his tongue to touch my cheek!\\n\\nAs for medical stuff, one of the hardest tight-ropes for my vet and I were walking was his Valium dosage. It clearly has alleviated the muscular aches and pains associated with alcohol withdrawal, but at the same time, we didn’t want him to become physically dependent on it so wanted him off it (or on a low dosage) so he wouldn’t suffer withdrawal when he had to cease the medication.\\n\\nFortunately, he was able to taper down quite rapidly with the discomfort from his withdrawal from the alcohol seemingly being roughly in line with his decrease in dose of Valium… except for the last couple of days where he’s been feeling even better and, as mentioned has been excited to have physical activity including going for walks, a run at the off leash dog park, playing tug of war with Chester (my other dog). It seems that what I’d feared the most, jumping off the Valium completely, turned out to be a non-issue…. I guess because dogs require such large doses maybe he wasn’t feeling anything from what was left and the days he seemed a bit lethargic from the Valium reduction was the time he ‘actually’ jumped off it? :-S Either way, I’m so happy for him!0\\n\\nBut one of the things I’m most thrilled to tell you is… Digger has discovered the joys of playing with toys!!! As I mentioned before, he has seemingly never has a proper toy (i.e. a plush toy or something with a ‘squeaker’ in it) but he’s starting to learn what they are and he LOVES them! He’s got a rubber pig that ‘oinks’ when squeezed plus a miniature plush horse. The horse, though, is slowly having it’s stuffing spread over the house as he seems to enjoy pulling it apart haha.\\n\\nHis social anxiety is also getting better, he’s able to be left alone for \\\\~5 minutes without getting worried in a room or other ‘boring’ situation, and for about 15 minutes in a situation that is somewhat exciting i.e. outside where he can see from our backyard through our front yard and into the street… observing people and other dogs coming and going. He’s really become part of our family, and while he’s still very attached to me, he’s also becoming more endeared to my partner and also my stepdad. He’s content to be ‘minded’ by them if I’ve had to be out all day or something like that!\\n\\nA lot of you have been asking about the legal situation with his former owners and their charges. After consulting with the mods, I am not allowed post a link to the newspaper article or give enough information they could be identified (although I’ve given enough that anyone with reasonable googlefu and Australian geography knowledge could put it together). That said, as I mentioned previously the Man and Woman whom owned digger previously, (the ones who gave him alcohol and were going to shoot him), are being held in custody on firearms and drugs charges awaiting their trial. However, in addition I’ve read that they are both facing 2 counts of sexual assault of a minor. As the minor wasn’t identified, I don’t know for sure, but I think I mentioned in a previous post I had suspected something was off and it wouldn’t surprise me if it was their own son and daughter whom are the victims.\\n\\nHowever, I know through the grapevine that now at least 10 children have been removed from the settlement by the department of child services, including a couple of my relatives, and they have been placed with foster parents. The police AND child services are taking a very hard look at the community as whole, and I wouldn’t be surprised if there are both more charges, and the community collapses due to the fact that almost all residents are facing some legal or social interventions by government agencies. While normally I would be sad about a tribe ceasing to exist, and in a way I still am, I am not sorry for the people involved. They were horrible human beings whom tolerated such depraved activity and used their remoteness to keep it hidden from authorities. Maybe once the tribe was ‘noble’, but I know what they have become is not something that can be overlooked by society, and what has happened is for the good of the children (and Digger) and the adults largely brought this on themselves. They had enough good land they could have made a reasonable living farming, but instead decided to sexually abuse children and to perform egregious animal cruelty. :-|\\n\\nOn a more positive note, I just want to say a giant THANK YOU to the r/dogs community for your support during this. At first I was very unsure of myself, and how this would go, but I am staggered and humbled at the amount of great practical advice I got, plus the enormous amount of encouragement to keep trying my best even when I wasn’t sure.\\n\\nI really wish that I had some way to let Digger know how many people around the world have been following his recovering and thinking of him, some to the point of tearing up, but the best I can do is just give him unlimited belly rubs. I also should thank my vet for going well and truly above the call of duty. For checking him physical examination every 3-4 days, and having done 4 liver and kidney panels on him, along with the medication, I tallied it up and have only spent \\\\~$750aud in total. I believe him when he says he is charging me exactly what it costs him to get the pathology tests done and the medication, and I also think he is courageous for assisting me despite the animal cruelty laws specifically stating that it is illegal to give a dog alcohol without exception, and thus putting his license potentially on the line by giving me the advice on how to wean him down!\\n\\nI am definitely blessed by having Digger join my family, and now can’t really imagine life without him. He’s slotted in just so perfectly with all of us. I’m also really glad that I have a happy ending for his saga to tell you. I will be sure to give an update in 6 months or so to let you know if he’s still going on the straight and narrow etc., but I think for now Digger has successfully beaten his alcohol dependence, as his last liver screen came back showing it’s improved a little already… Go digger :’-)\\n\\nFor those wanting to see other photo\\'s, here are photo\\'s I\\'ve taken of him through-out his journey to recovery...\\n\\n1.

Anyhow, I\\'m really happy to report that I consider that Digger is cured... he\\'s not needed any alcohol of meds for well over a month now, and blood-work I received today shows his liver function as normal... How amazing is that?\\n\\nTo start off, here\\'s a photo my partner took of him on the way back from the vets today!(https://imgur.com/a/HjhMfCv). (Note all the dog hair on my arm where he nuzzles me while I drive haha)\\n\\nEDIT to Add Extra Photo\\'s:\\n\\n1. Photo of him giving me a tongue kiss!(https://imgur.com/a/czXfXQD) 2) Low quality animation of him licking my face!(https://imgur.com/a/99PQW1y)\\n\\nThank you r/Dogs, you are amazing!\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n***TL;DR quick background:*** *A family had been feeding their dog the equivalent of 1 bottle of full strength wine (half in morning, half at night) every day for more than 6 months as they thought it was funny to see the dog be drunk and classed it as a ‘trick’ that he must do or they wouldn’t feed him. When I met these people they were getting sick of the dog due to him no longer acting drunk despite him drinking so much, and were planning on shooting him. I saved them a bullet, but the dog was physically dependent on alcohol and needed to be given some regularly to stop him from becoming agitated and eventually just laying on the floor trembling, throwing up, with a glassy stare. After some initial hesitation due to laws against giving dogs alcohol, a vet (whom is a personal friend) decided to help me treat him and gave me meds to help the dog through ‘withdrawal’ and will help assess his taper.*\\n\\n*Liver and kidney tests initially showed he has liver impairment, but not to an extent that was irrecoverable or that is likely to falter soon. His kidneys showed a mild impairment but no immediate danger, though he may have issues in his older age. However, more recent testing as I weaned him completely off alcohol have shown already an improvement in his liver function! I reported his owners to the police, as I had taken photo\\'s of their illegally owned and stored firearms, as well as an amateur meth lab. This resulted in a raid on the property with many adults arrested, and children being taken into care because either both their parents are now being held in custody OR they were found to be being severely neglected i.e. some as old as \\\\~12 had never been to school and were completely illiterate. It doesn\\'t look like their will be any charges over the animal cruelty, though I have been asked to testify (via video link due to the distance) at a couple of upcoming trials and it\\'s fairly certain that those responsible will end up in jail (especially with the new sexual assault of a minor charges they have received, detailed below).*\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n**Reminder - I am not the original poster.**', 't2_cyrgtnco', 'Seeking advice from anyone that had rehabilitated an alcoholic dog.

(Although, I guess most parents think of their kids that way.)\\n\\nI quit drinking about 2 months ago and have been adamant about doing the AA program correctly - 90 meetings in 90 days, sponsor, daily readings, therapy, etc. I really want to be a good mom and make up for my bad decisions when I was drinking. (I never harmed him or put him in danger but I just wasn’t present and am remorseful about my drinking past.)\\n\\nThe problem is that I’m a single mom who works full-time and I live in a small town. Because it’s small, there aren’t a lot of options in terms of AA meetings, so the only one I can really attend is the 5:30 based on my schedule and my son’s. His father has him part-time, so on those days, I can attend meetings by myself but on my days I HAVE to bring my son. I don’t have anyone to leave him with and babysitting wouldn’t work because nobody wants to babysit for just one hour - it doesn’t financially make sense for them.\\n\\nSo, I take my son to meetings. Naturally, he isn’t too thrilled when I have to. (Before you suggest I could do zoom meetings, i really don’t get anything out of them. I like the in-person connection and atmosphere).\\n\\nMy ex (who has never taken my alcoholism seriously and has never actually attended an AA meeting) says I’m TA for exposing our child to “that kind of atmosphere” and “those kinds of people.” The truth is, “those people” are what have saved my life. They are so sweet and good with my son and, while sometimes the subject matter can be a little adult-ish, we mostly talk about how to be better people and live a spiritually-sound existence and to help our fellow man. I personally think it’s good for my son to be surrounded by people that are trying to better themselves and also to let him know at an early age the effects of alcoholism as it runs in my family, but maybe I’m TA and way off the mark and am doing more damage than good. I would just like outside opinions that aren’t emotionally connected to the situation.\\n\\nAITA for taking my 7 year old to AA meetings with some of the topics that are addressed?\\n\\nEdit: I super appreciate everyone’s responses! It gave me a lot of insight. Admittedly, I didn’t really think about how other members may feel about having a child there - I was mostly thinking about the comfort of my son. I WILL say that the group is all old-timers that have years of sobriety and largely just talk about service work and how much better their lives are. But, as many have pointed out, the presence of a child may deter members from talking about serious subjects, so I’ll either just give my kid headphones and a tablet to play with (something I usually hate doing but I guess I’ll just have to suck it up) or do zoom meetings when I have him. Again, thank you for ALL of the input (even the ppl that were incredibly harsh with their verdict).\\n\\nUpdate: AITA for forcing my 7-year-old to go to AA?(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/x43sit/aita_for_making_my_7yearold_go_to_alcoholics/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_term=1) \\\\- Monday, April 10th. 2023\\n\\n***UPDATE***\\n\\nFirst and most importantly, I’m still sober and feel better than I have in years. I can now be more present and a better mom to my child, and for that, I’m incredibly grateful. AA has quite literally saved my life and if anyone who is reading this struggles with addiction, I just want to say there IS a way out - you just have to know YOU ARE WORTH IT and SOBRIETY is worth it.\\n\\nMy first post ended up being a mixed bag in terms of judgements about my assholery. I accept my judgment of being the AH but I did want to clarify a common misconception. Abstaining from alcohol is just a small portion of AA. A much larger portion is dedicated to is looking into WHY we drink, take accountability for our selfish actions and apologize accordingly and to rectify our character defects so we can be better ppl to our friends and family. Because of these aspects, I was hoping exposing my son to the program would teach him something about accountability, patience, and empathy.\\n\\nI ended up just asking my AA home group if it bothered them that I brought my son to meetings. Not only did everyone look at me like I grew a second head for even asking for permission, every parent in the group talked about their own children growing up in AA and how “you do what you have to do to stay sober.” Essentially, the consensus was that it is far better for a kid to have to be dragged to meetings a few hours a week than to have a mom drunk all the time.\\n\\nI still take my son to AA meetings, but now I allow him to play on my tablet with headphones. (I got reamed in the comments for not allowing my kid to do this before. Fair enough. I just have this “thing” about kids being on technology as a quick fix for boredom, but I need to get over that.)\\n\\nMy son gets a lot of treats and gifts from my home group members. One dude gives him $10s and $20s every time he sees my son (I know, right? Untapped resource!). My son is learning how to play electric guitar, and two AA members will rift with my son and talk music (Jimmy Hendrix is currently my son’s hero). All in all, my son likes the attention and says he doesn’t mind going to meetings.\\n\\nA surprising update in all of this is that my son’s dad has stopped drinking. (Although he currently refuses to attend AA). My relationship with my ex is much better and my kiddo seems much happier as a whole.\\n\\nLife for all of us is just… better. And while I don’t want to turn this into a public endorsement for AA, I just want to say that sobriety is hands-down the best thing that’s ever happened to my family.', 't2_95u4hpflc', 'AITA for making my 7-year-old go to Alcoholics Anonymous? + Update', 't3_12psv0h', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/12psv0h/aita_for_making_my_7yearold_go_to_alcoholics/'), ('13h65h7', '2023-May-14 02:58', 'entertainment', 't5_2qh0f', '', 't2_5lzl17hr', '‘I kept my alcoholism secret on Mission: Impossible set,’ Simon Pegg reveals', 't3_13h65h7', 'https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/may/14/alcoholism-mission-impossible-simon-pegg-bbc-desert-island-discs-drinking'), ('rwcd4t', '2022-Jan-04 21:02', 'ShittyLifeProTips', 't5_2tgym', '', 't2_9vcdnzeb', 'SLPT: Alcohol', 't3_rwcd4t', 'https://i.redd.it/i1we9pmwbs981.jpg'), ('15p56t4', '2023-Aug-12 08:53', 'AskReddit', 't5_2qh1i', '', 't2_ff913r9j', 'What would you do if you were 5 months into sobriety and a friend repeatedly offers you weed and alcohol?', 't3_15p56t4', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/15p56t4/what_would_you_do_if_you_were_5_months_into/'), ('15maf4a', '2023-Aug-09 04:35', 'CasualUK', 't5_3j2jr', '', 't2_5f3fs86a', 'How is this allowed?

She never said what kind of fridge she would like though and so in the end she dropped it and my parents bought us the expensive fridge when we moved in. \\n\\nIt’s been a while now and I frequently use the ice cube dispenser while she just keeps all her drinks in the fridge and takes up loads of space, so yesterday when I tried to fit in other groceries I bought, I took out all her drinks so she will have to use the ice cube dispenser now if she wants a cold drink.

For context my friend (42M) his gf (48F) and their two friends (also mid 40\\'s M&amp;F) were hosting this party the **4 of them together.**\\n\\nA few weeks ago when I received the invitation I realized that it said on it something along the lines of \"please be prepared to purchase your own drinks\". Didn\\'t think much of it at the time considering I just thought they were hiring a bar tender or something, but fast forward to the day of the party.\\n\\nI arrive with my wife and it\\'s my friend and his gf standing behind their kitchen counter that they were using as their \"bar\", making/charging the guests for drinks. Now I was confused for a few reasons...\\n\\n1, the fact that this party was held at my friends house, it\\'s not like this was at an event space or something where this would be normal imo. 2, there was no bar tender that they hired or anything like that. It was literally 2 of the 4 of them standing in the kitchen at a time making drinks for people and then charging them accordingly (drinks were all under $10).\\n\\nNow idk if this is actually a common thing, but I have never in my 42 years of living been to a \"party\" at a friends house where the hosts are charging you themselves for drinks.\\n\\nI\\'ve had multiple parties over the years, that I have invited my friend and his gf to in which they have attended, and I\\'ve never charged **ANYONE** for drinks ever. I\\'ve always bought all the drinks myself and had an open bar type of situation. Where my guests can make there own drinks. I even had a proper bar tender once and still no one was charged, it was an open bar.\\n\\nI honestly felt like my friend, his gf and their friends were all trying to make a quick buck off of their guests who attended. Clearly to cover to cost of the drinks. Which yeah I understand that booze isn\\'t cheap these days but we\\'re talking splitting the cost of whatever they bought between **4 PEOPLE**. Like in my opinion if you can\\'t afford to supply drinks at your party, why are you having a party in the first place?\\n\\nThis also wasn\\'t for charity or anything the money made off of the drinks was for them to split.\\n\\nMy wife and I bought one drink each, stayed for about an hour or so, and said our goodbyes. When we were leaving my friend asked why we didn\\'t have that much to drink? I told him because I think it\\'s ridiculous that they are charging their close friends for drinks. He called me cheap and an unsupportive friend. I assured him that i\\'m not, if the charging of drinks was for a good cause (like profits go to charity or something) of course i\\'d buy drinks.\\n\\nI told him I find the fact that they are charging for drinks, and keeping the money for themselves ridiculous and taking advantage of their friends. Anyway now my friend and his gf are butt hurt about this and have been calling me an AH to our mutual friends. AITA here?\\n\\n(EDIT: Wow! I did not expect this post to blow up like this but thank you guys.\\n\\nFor any of those wondering, after reading these comments my wife and I have decided to exclude my \"friend\" and his gf from any of our future parties.

However, socially EVERY outing involves drinking. Pool? Drink. Rooftop? Drink. Picnic? Champagne. Bar? Of course drink. \\n\\nLike I get slightly hungry after 11pm too, men should hit on women by sending them over something off the appetizer menu or a dessert plate instead. We’re out all night, liquid alcohol isn’t going to keep me standing. We need carbs. Thanks. I’m also wanting to hilariously point out that for those messaging me as a gold digger for wanting an alternative to alcohol, honey.. you have NO gold. (Imagine me making a post about a serious purchase like.. um a car or house). \\n\\nEdit: A lot of men here have probably never been in a social situation where they wanted to befriend an attractive girl at a bar and bought her a drink or two (generously offered) before. Otherwise you wouldn’t have your panties in a bunch over * *gasp* *such expensive appetizers :/ I feel bad for the ladies in your city who have to be subjected to such ridiculous behavior. If you have a problem with treating someone, say it. (Like, really way to announce you’re a man that has nothing to spare cuz women are SO expensive right?! What about being able to provide for a family? Lmao). Don’t ridicule the social norm. Lol\\n\\nBut all in all, thanks for some enthusiastic comments about treating a girl to some bar food if she doesn’t like drinking. It’s definitely a good starter and you can spend a bit more time with her. It’s also a tad harder to run away with a plate of wings.\\n\\nEdit 2: Also to go deeper because ya’ll reallyyyy wanna go there. Even as far as to go and call women prostitutes for asking for appetizers instead. LOL. Some have pointed out that alcohol is preferred and that “beggars shouldn’t be choosers and just be grateful a drink was bought for you” because a guy has the advantage when a girl is drunk. So if you care if she’s a bit hungry or not, it doesn’t benefit the men trying to get laid that night. Because buying a complimentary drink is to not be nice. In fact food slows down how fast a girl can get drunk. So that’s why ya’ll are mad when women want the food alternative to alcohol. Alcohol is to inebriate women, wings don’t. It all makes sense now.

It seems he was expecting everyone to bring food or drinks. \\n\\nMy question is, is this normal? I'm from the south and the idea of inviting a guest out on a trip and not bringing food would literally make me whither and die.  Also I have never been anywhere near water, including a backyard pool, that wasn't fully stocked with alcohol, food and anything in-between.

He has me well-trained to attend to his every need.\\n\\nOne of his quirks is that he basically won’t drink water from a bowl. He also won’t drink from any number of fancy cat fountains we have tried. He only likes the tiniest drips and trickles of water flowing freely from a tub faucet.\\n\\nNow, I’ve had this cat for 10 years so I love him but this is a TIFU a decade in the making. He loves drinking water. He constantly will walk into the living room and sit down with his cute dumb little face covered in water after drinking from the thin trickle in the tub.\\n\\nI’m living in Houston, a city I really love, but which is in the state of Texas where we can’t get our collective deregulated stuff together. We’ve had electric outages for days and now we are under a boil water notice.\\n\\nMy special little butthole kept going into the bathroom and knocking things down because he was trying to get me to go in there and turn the water on. He doesn’t understand that the water might kill him right now. He only knows that he’s thirsty.\\n\\nAnd when this cat wants something, he gets it. There’s no point in deterring him. Any normal deterrents that work on other cats—covering surfaces in tinfoil, bitter sprays, spray bottle, tape—do not deter him. Ignoring him doesn’t work because he will escalate to knocking over bigger and bigger objects until you come see him, then he purrs and winds around your legs like the little spoiled prince that he is.\\n\\nSo, the Dark Lord was thirsty and I couldn’t put his water on, and he kept knocking down my lotion. I finally took a water bottle over the tub and poured a trickle out for him to drink. Then I moved one of the big spout spring water containers to the tub, opened the spout to a trickle, and then sat by my dumb fluffy asshole until he was done drinking because I have no idea when we will get water back.\\n\\nTLDR; TIFU by having the pickiest fluffy spoiled cat prince who is adding to the stress of our broken utilities situation in Texas by making me figure out how to water him properly.\\n\\nEdit: I really appreciate all the stories of equally picky cats, as well as the faucet-style fountains! They live such charmed lives. Mine has tried multiple cat fountains and rejected all of them, I think because he doesn’t like the noise, so I hope to find his holy grail fountain one day. He does have clean, cold water bowls refreshed daily far away from his food. His sister drinks from it. He won’t.

We’d barely arrived and decided to celebrate by going out for a nice meal to a restaurant recommended by a friend. We’d been forewarned that the service standard was crap in general, so we came with a low bar. \\n\\nThe meal was nice, the service ok (low expectations prevent disappointment) and the conversation really good. We were excited about our new adventure and happy to finally be there. So we decided to follow the meal up with a cocktail since the restaurant had a fully stocked bar (in full view). We call the server over to order and the conversation went something like this:\\n\\nHusband - Hi! We’d like to order some drinks please\\n\\nServer - Ok sure, what would you like?\\n\\nHusband - For me a glass of red wine please\\n\\nServer - Ok. And for you miss?\\n\\nMe - I’d like a gin and tonic please\\n\\nServer - No. We don’t have cocktails\\n\\nMe - What do you mean? You have a fully stocked bar..?  (Seriously this was a BIG, very complete bar)\\n\\nServer - We don’t have cocktails\\n\\nMe - (flabbergasted) Ummm, but you have everything you need to make them, right?\\n\\nServer - I wouldn’t know. We don’t have cocktails\\n\\nAt this point I sit back in my chair while my brain tries to process the situation...then promptly sit back up, an MC lightbulb going on in my brain. \\n\\nMe - Ok, do you have gin?\\n\\nServer - Yes\\n\\nMe - Do you have tonic water?\\n\\nServer - Yes\\n\\nMe - Perfect, then please bring me a glass of straight gin, a glass filled with ice and a can of tonic water\\n\\nServer - Ok\\n\\nI seriously don’t know what they expected to happen but they bring everything over and then I proceed to mix my own drink at the table while making eye contact with a big grin on my face. And since the glasses were highballs I actually got a double! It was hilarious to see the server huffing away.\\n\\nEdit: to the people asking this repeated question in the comments, please bear in mind that this whole story and exchange happened in Spanish, where there is no real usage for “drink” for simple mixed alcoholic drinks, we pretty much use “cóctel” for all of them.

They were a pleasure to have as customers. They ordered four of our house cocktails to start with and then went over the menu for their entrees. \\n\\nWhen I was on my way back to their booth with the drinks on a tray, I walked by the back side and overheard one of them talking about how she was 14 weeks along. When I rounded back, they were talking about the same topic and it was clear to me that she was pregnant. I figured her having one drink wasn't a big deal. They ordered their entrees and I went off to handle other tables.\\n\\nAbout five minutes later, they called me over again and asked for another round. At this point I started getting concerned, but I took the order and cheerfully said I'd be right back. This time, I went to the bartender, and asked him to make one of them a virgin cocktail. He was confused but since he's a good friend of mine, I told him to just trust me. \\n\\nA few cocktails later (hers strictly virgin) they started getting rowdy, and Mrs. Pregnant Woman was also getting into it. I figured that since she didn't notice, things were OK. The problem came when I took them their check, and they asked to split the bill at the register. When Mrs. Pregnant Woman got to the counter, I saw her cocktails were marked with (virgin). My bartender had edited each in the system for inventory.\\n\\nIt was too late for me to edit them back, so I just had her pay, hoping that she wouldn't look at the receipt. They all thanked me and left, leaving a generous tip in the process. They were talking in the parking lot for the next short while, presumably waiting for an Uber.\\n\\nSeveral minutes later Mrs. Pregnant Woman came back and asked what (virgin) on the receipt meant. I fessed up that it meant non-alcoholic. She blank stared me for a few seconds and then asked if she had ordered a non-alcoholic cocktail. I said no, but told her that I assumed she wanted one seeing as she was pregnant. It was a lame lie and I'll admit it, but she looked me in the eye and asked me to return her part of the tip. I did so. Then she talked to my manager. My manager took me into her office and literally shrieked at me until hoarse. \\n\\nI stood my ground and told her that I'm not going to be responsible for FAS. She told me that she was taking me off the calendar until she decided what to do with me. She also informed me that I could get the restaurant in serious trouble for discrimination, and upon examination of my state's laws, she is correct. \\n\\nBut when I talked to my mother and father about it tonight, they told me that they understood my position. The entire staff at the restaurant is against me and I think that I'm going to call in and tell my manager that I quit, but I still feel in the right here.

There is currently a planned protest across hundreds of subreddits(https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/) to black out on June 12th. The moderators at /r/cocktails have been discussing our participation, and while we’ve come to a vote and agreement internally, we wanted to ensure that whatever action we take is largely supported by our community.\\n\\n\\n#What’s Happening\\n\\n* Third Party reddit apps (such as Apollo, Reddit is Fun and others) are going to become ludicrously more expensive for it’s developers to run, which will in turn either kill the apps, or result in a monthly fee to the users if they choose to use one of those apps to browse. Put simply, each request to reddit within these mobile apps will cost the developer money. The developers of Apollo were quoted around $2 million per month for the current rate of usage. The only way for these apps to continue to be viable for the developer is if you (the user) pay a monthly fee, and realistically, this is most likely going to just outright kill them. Put simply: If you use a third party app to browse reddit, you will most likely no longer be able to do so, or be charged a monthly fee to keep it viable.\\n\\n* NSFW Content is no longer going to be available in the API. This means that, even if 3rd party apps continue to survive, or even if you pay a fee to use a 3rd party app, you will not be able to access NSFW content on it. You will only be able to access it on the official reddit app. Additionally, some service bots (such as video downloaders or maybe remindme bots) will not be able to access anything NSFW. In more major cases, it may become harder for moderators of NSFW subreddits to combat serious violations such as CSAM due to certain mod tools being restricted from accessing NSFW content.\\n\\n* Many users with visual impairments rely on 3rd-party applications in order to more easily interface with reddit, as the official reddit mobile app does not have robust support for visually-impaired users. This means that a great deal of visually-impaired redditors will no longer be able to access the site in the assisted fashion they’re used to.\\n\\n* Many moderators rely on 3rd-party tools in order to effectively moderate their communities. When the changes to the API kicks in, moderation across the board will not only become more difficult, but it will result in lower consistency, longer wait times on post approvals and reports, and much more spam/bot activity getting through the cracks. In discussions with mods on many subreddits, many longtime moderators will simply leave the site. While it’s tradition for redditors to dunk on moderators, the truth is that they do an insane amount of work for free, and the entire site would drastically decrease in quality and usability without them.\\n\\n\\n#Open Letter to reddit &amp; Blackout\\n\\nIn light of what’s happening above, an open letter has been released(https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/13xh1e7/an_open_letter_on_the_state_of_affairs_regarding/) by the broader moderation community, and /r/cocktails will be supporting it.

Honestly, not the worst system in theory, in practice however?\\n\\nSo Friday night begins, it’s a busy one so we’re all going full throttle, until I walk past the cocktail prep area and notice the tickets are piling up and the cocktail girls are nowhere to be seen. \\n\\nTaking some initiative I get started on making some drinks, here I should mention, I’ve worked bar jobs the majority of my adulthood, I know how to make cocktails, especially the v basic ones available at this bar, and, even if it wasn’t essentially second nature to me at this point, the instructions for each drink are quite literally taped to the back of the prep station, essentially, I know what I’m doing.\\n\\nI’m about halfway done with the tickets when my manager appears and reprimands me for making cocktails when I’m ‘not trained’, reminds me that I should leave it to the ‘experts’ and to get back to the (at this point very quiet) rest of the bar. I tried pointing out that I have no idea where these ‘experts’ have vanished to (they’ve been gone for about 20 minutes at this point) and that I’ve had more extensive training in previous jobs, but he won’t hear me, yells that I’ve been told before and that under NO CIRCUMSTANCES am I to prepare or assist with cocktails in any way other than delivering tickets, and that these things should be left to the experts, so I decide that sure, you want your ‘experts’ on it, I’ll leave them to it. \\n\\nAs the night goes on I take orders and find myself to be not very busy. I take some cocktail orders, print the tickets, take them over and add them to the ever-growing stack, and go back to just standing around, there are about five of us regular ol’ bar staff at this point just standing around since everything that needs to be done has been done, and other than a few elderly regulars, everyone wants cocktails. \\n\\nHowever, the two girls are somewhat overwhelmed at this point and the manager is helping them out, customers are coming up to complain, requesting refunds and to cancel their order, which requires a manager to do. \\n\\nSo the manager, more than a little flustered at this point, comes over and sees us all standing around, and demands we do something. We kindly point out that everything has been restocked, glasses collected, garnished prepped, everything cleaned to within an inch of it’s life, customers are being seen to when they appear and there’s nothing else that any of us lowly lot can do without his permission or assistance. \\n\\nSo he makes a request that anyone in his position would make ‘ok go help out the cocktails they’re overwhelmed!’ the others hop to it while I stay where I am, he isn’t impressed and verbalises as much. Until I remind him, under no circumstances am I to assist cocktails in any way. That I’ll happily bring tickets over for them, but as he kindly pointed out earlier, I’d been told previously, and I wasn’t going to go against his orders again now was I? \\n\\nHe was pissed but couldn’t actually find a valid argument and just stormed off. Throughout the night I watched as he and the experts struggled to keep up, I dealt with customers complaining that their drinks were taking 30+ minutes to arrive, and kindly explained that unfortunately, I wasn’t able to assist in making their drinks as I was under strict instructions, and who was I to disagree with a manager?', 't2_2sz60c6g', 'Want me to leave the cocktails to the ‘experts’?

I have the receipt for this order too. \\n\\nThere’s a specific wine I use to pair with food the closest total wine that had it was a 60 mile drive and it was storming out and I wanted it for the holidays because most likely was going to be cooped up inside.\\n\\nSo I drive over, this used to be my typical total wine until I moved 2 counties away. \\n\\nAnyways I go in and pickup the wine and get some other stuff for holiday parties was in there maybe an hour and it comes time to check out and the cashier asks me for my iD so I give it to her and then she tells me she needs to see the iD of the other person I was with so now I’m confused and say I’m alone? And she says well I have to go get my manager. Ok fine? \\n\\nSo he comes out to tell me that she told him I was with someone and they need to come back and bring their iD or they won’t sell it to me. \\n\\nI told him I wasn’t with anyone. He asks to see my iD looks at it and says “well unfortunately you look young”\\n\\nAt this point I’m like are you serious??? And he’s like “you can come back tomorrow ALONE” \\n\\nI find it extremely disrespectful to tell someone they look young while you’re holding their iD in your hand and not to mention I’ve been shopping at that exact location for about 4 years and have never had a problem \\n\\nSo I told him about how I drove there and have been shopping there for years and that I even have a second form of iD and he was just kind of giggling and saying no.\\n\\nSo I left very angry and it was late around 9 pm and then I had the about hour and a half drive back home in the rain storm.\\n\\nSo I was home pissed about it all night and the next day I went in to the one close to my house to get the other stuff I was getting unfortunately that one was out of the wine that’s why I didn’t originally go there.\\n\\nThey were pleasant as usual actually beyond nice and didn’t even iD me which just goes to show the other location was on some kind of power trip or something. \\n\\n\\nThen I got an email from them to review my experience. Which they send every time I go there and I never do it but I decided to select the location I had the bad experience at and give feed back on it.\\n\\nSo I wrote exactly what happened and then the next day I got a call from the store manager. Turns out the guy that night was an assistant manager or something. However he was much more pleasant than the woman that called me. She was extremely rude and condescending and told me that she reviewed the cameras and that someone walked in with me at the same time and that made us a party. I told her I didn’t know them. She said it didn’t matter. so apparently people can’t walk in to total wine at the same time as you???\\n\\nThen she said that the employees were watching me and that the person left 30 minutes before I went to check out and they saw it.\\n\\nOk so? Also if that is the case and that is your policy, why didn’t you say something when you saw the person leave and we could have cleared up the whole situation right then and there. Instead of continuing to allow me to shop for another 30 minutes and waste my time to know that when I came to check out you were going to deny it? \\n\\nSo I told her even if that is the case someone can’t leave a store??? And she said “no. To complete the transaction they would have to drive back with their iD” \\n\\nThis made me extremely angry because even if that is the case and that is your policy at least you can offer an apology for the inconvenience or something like that. Not just call me to argue and stir the pot. I was already kind of over it because it had been like 2 days but just her whole attitude and nastiness about the whole thing was really insult to injury. \\n\\nSo I decided to look up their policy and their policy clearly states that this only applies to parties at checkout so the rule is who is with you at checkout which that makes sense or is at least more understandable. \\n\\nAnother policy I read which was interesting was that any online order not picked up within a week they will issue a full refund to your original payment method.\\n\\n\\nSo my friends and I were sitting home drinking the stuff I had got at the other location later that day and telling them what happened and they were all shocked. \\n\\n\\nI used to work retail for a long time specifically during covid and I know what an inconvenience it is to setup big curbside pickup orders because they take up a lot of space on the order shelf. \\n\\nSo drunk and mad I decided to enforce their own policy on them and make a $10,000 order for the soonest possible pickup time which they promise orders ready in 3 hours.\\n\\nSo I made sure to order the cheapest heaviest bottles I could think of so it can take up the most amount of space in their curbside are and made sure to only order like 1 or 2 of each so they couldn’t just give me a case they had to get individual ones and I ordered their whole supply of Tito’s since it’s popular and it’s the holidays and I know people are going to be looking for it and this total wine has its curbside order section in the front behind a counter where you can see it \\n\\nAnd I know when customers saw it they would ask for it and then they would have to explain how someone ordered all 238 bottles and they’re back there on reserve. Then they’d probably get grouchy and ask for a manager.\\n\\nBut the manager would be busy because I also made sure to order a lot of bottles behind glass so they would have to run around with their keys scrambling to get this order ready. I worked retail and I know how much stuff like this throws off a schedule and annoys the managers. \\n\\nSo I loaded up the cart and stopped when I got bored and placed the order. I got the email confirmation which specified that you have to wait for the pickup confirmation email and that pickup times aren’t guaranteed so I thought for sure they were either going to cancel the order or call me or something.\\n\\nAnd something interesting that is sent with the email is a pickup policy that states specifically “the recipient of the order needs to be 21” so you can have other people in your car not 21??? \\n\\nWell 5 hours later I got the pickup email. It took them longer but I was still surprised.\\n\\nThen later I got a pickup reminder email. Then 3 days later a second reminder. Then 7 days I got my “final notice” email\\n\\nAnd then day 10 I got a phone call. It was the manager acting like a completely different person this time asking when I was coming for the order. At this point I think she knew I was fucking with them because it had been 10 days and she knew my name from the previous feedback thing because when she called she asked for me by name and my name was on the order \\n\\nSo I told her “yeah I went to pick it up and was told I look too young, so I just went to the other total wine and picked it up the same stuff there” \\n\\nSo then she was mad and said “are you seriously not coming to pick this up?” Lollll restockkkkkkk \\n\\nI just said “nahhh”\\n\\nShe hung up lmfaooooo\\n\\n\\nWhen your higher up asked you why your store had to refund someone $10,000 explain to them what you did  lmfaooo.\\n\\nThey were supposed to automatically cancel the order at the 7 day mark but didn’t she called me at the 10 day. \\n\\nSo I called their customer service line to cancel it and she told me some stores wait to the end of the month to do it. \\n\\nI’m assuming the manger was trying to hold out on refunding to end the year on a better number.

The most recent time was because my sis wanted to do a wine tasting while we were on a trip together. \\n\\nAt the winery, I found the first wine that I’ve actually enthusiastically liked: a spicy wine infused with hot peppers. I bought a bottle, took it home, and put it in my section of the shared pantry. \\n\\nA couple of months went by without incident. Then one Friday night, I came home to Morgan and two of her friends drinking it. I confronted her about it, and she said that her friend had opened it without knowing it was mine. Morgan apparently realized the mistake but thought it would be ok because I’ve “said that I don’t like wine before.” \\n\\n??? What makes you think that made it ok? Ive said that before, yes, but this is literally the only wine I’ve ever enjoyed enough to buy a bottle of.

I want her to get me another bottle of the actual wine that she and her friends drank.\\n\\nHer eyes got really wide and she started complaining about how that winery is a three hour drive away, and that wasn’t fair because it was her friend who opened it and not her.\\n\\nHonestly?

She could have told her friend that it was mine, put it away, and told me about it, and I would’ve understood. But no, she let them go ahead and even poured herself a glass.

I would only wear the dress at the wedding itself, and I would switch to a more casual dress for the reception. When I was wearing the dress, I wouldn’t eat or drink anything except water, and I would stay inside at all times.\\n\\nI promise I’m not usually this crazy about cleanliness, but this was my mom’s dress, and the thought of it being damaged broke my heart. But I also knew I wanted to wear it when I got married to have a piece of her with me. She adored this dress and always dreamed I would wear it. \\n\\nMy bridesmaids knew very well about my particularities with the dress. I had a room above the venue where I was getting ready. My dress was hanging in a safe place in the room. \\n\\nOn the day of the wedding, I went down to check on something for the wedding, leaving my bridesmaids in the room. Here’s what happened, as they told it to me:\\n\\nThey opened a bottle of Pinot Noir (my favorite) as a celebration. They poured themselves glasses and began to walk around checking out the room. One of my bridesmaids, “Anna,” (27 F) wanted to get a closer look at my dress. She got really close to it, and she started touching the lace. Somehow, her hand holding the wine glass slipped, and wine spilled all over the bottom of the dress. \\n\\nWhen I came upstairs, they told me what happened, and I started sobbing. My maid of honor called several professional cleaners, and they said there was no way they could get the dress in before the wedding. They told us ways to save the dress until we could get it into them, so my MOH started doing that.\\n\\nAfter that call, I became extremely angry. I asked “Anna” what the hell she was doing holding red wine so close to my dress when she knew how careful I was being. She dismissed it and said it wasn’t such a big deal because I was planning to wear the dress, so it could have gotten damaged that way too. \\n\\nI couldn’t believe she said that. I called her thoughtless and careless and stupid. I told her that she was no longer part of the wedding and that I wanted her to leave. She left, and neither of us have reached out to the other since. \\n\\nI got married in the dress I had planned to wear for the reception, and I was heartbroken not to be wearing my mom’s dress.

In the midst of her cleaning, she accidentally knocked  over a dish from the drying rack and that dish landed on and shattered  an expensive wine glass of mine. I say mine because it was given to me  by my mother as a Christmas gift last year. The glass retails for around  $120.\\n\\nWhen she told me she had  broken the glass by accident (which she was very nervous about because  she knew the glass was expensive), we had a discussion (may classify  this as an argument...) that lasted three days about how it would get  replaced, and who would pay. After all of this talking, she finally (she  says) gave in and gave me 40% of the cost to replace the glass. I had  initially asked that she replace the glass in full, but after discussion  realized if we are partners, it would be logical to use the 60/40  calculation we use for everything else.\\n\\nBackground:  Trish and I have been living together for about a year. When we  initially decided to move in together, we decided to split all expenses  60%/40% because of our combined income distribution (I make 60% of our  gross monthly earnings, she makes 40%).\\n\\nAfter  the initial agreement, Trish has now said she does not feel good about  the agreement and wants me to give the money back to her. Her reasoning  is that (A) it was a complete accident, and (B) she would never want to  buy any wine glasses that expensive ever again. My argument is that if  we are to live together, we are going to be sharing costs, and  inevitably things are going to break and need replacing/repairing. I  liked this wine glass (again which was a gift from my mother) and would  like to replace it so that we have a matching set once more.\\n\\nMore  background: I know for a fact that Trish is financially able to  reimburse me the 40%, and would suffer no undue hardship from the loss  of those funds. On the other hand, I am also fully able to replace the  glass without it affecting my financial stability.\\n\\nAITA for asking Trish to reimburse 40% of the wine glass she broke by accident?\\n\\nEDIT: It appears that according to popular sentiment IATA. I have therefore given Trish back her money. Thank you to the commenters that gave gentle and thoughtful wisdom on what they believed might be more of the root cause of this argument. I don't think we've been in a good place for a long time. And asking her for money was never about control. I wanted to see her take personal responsibility, because that is what I would have done.\\n\\nFYI Trish was with me and signed off on this post before I submitted it. She has read all of the comments. After doing so, we now understand that she does not wish to have such nice things, and is worried about being too materialistic, as well as a prisoner in her own home, having to walk on eggshells in the fear that she might break something else. She is also sad that I was not able to show compassion and let it slide. I do struggle with showing empathy and compassion sometimes. \\n\\nAnd I also agree with the people who have commented on the argument spanning three days. It's exhausting for both of us. Life is too short. We have little fights like this all the time, and it's wearing on both of us. It might be time to call it quits.\", 't2_s10d83jl', 'AITA For Asking My Girlfriend To Pay For The Wine Glass She Broke?', 't3_x144he', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/x144he/aita_for_asking_my_girlfriend_to_pay_for_the_wine/'), ('x87xu2', '2022-Sep-07 10:23', 'Damnthatsinteresting', 't5_2xxyj', '', 't2_s1vx3d6o', 'The Speyer wine bottle is a bottle of liquid, probably wine, originally found near Speyer, in Germany, in 1867, and has been called the world’s oldest existing bottle of wine.

Two people sat themselves in my section at a dirty table (the table cloth hadn’t even been changed.) The people weren’t RUDE exactly, while we resat the table, they asked “Where’s our menus?” While the busser, me, and hosts are trying to move around them clearing glasses and plates. They acted confused if anything, like, how DARE this table not be ready for us at a reservation based fine dining restaurant. \\n\\nI got waters, and tried to do my spiel (the whole these are our chef specials etc etc) and they interrupted me. “If I order a glass of wine, do I pay for it?” I thought I misheard so I asked “What do you mean?” And they repeated themselves “If I order a glass of wine do I pay for it?”\\n\\nI said very professionally, “Yes it will be on your bill at the end of the dining experience.”\\n\\n“Oh…” they said, disappointed and confused. “Do I want the burger or the salmon?”\\n\\n“Hmm, are you in the mood for red meat or seafood? The burger is garnished with xyz and sits between a baked in house blah blah bun, rich savory flavors, while the salmon is a top x vegetables and a brightly flavored z glaze.”\\n\\nAgain, a stair of confusion. \\n\\n“I can give you a moment if you would like to review the menu further.”\\n\\n“No, we’re ready now.”\\n\\n“Ok, what would you like?”\\n\\n“I don’t know.”\\n\\nIn my brain right now I’m just wondering, WTF is happening? There is no language barrier. There doesn’t seem to be a culture barrier. They aren’t acting rude or upset, just confused. They’re well dressed and at least 40, they HAVE to have gone to a restaurant before to know how this works. \\n\\nThe other friend then says “She’s asking you want to order.” Ok alright. She want me to decide for her. That’s actually pretty common, you just need to explicitly say that. \\n\\n“Alright, I suggest the salmon then. And for you?”\\n\\n“I’ll have the BlahBlah filet, well done. Absolutely no pink.”\\n\\nI repeat the order back, they agreed, I think I’m in the clear, and I’m about to walk away. \\n\\n“Will you bring us appetizers?”\\n\\n“Of course, what would you like?”\\n\\nThem, not even opening the menu. “Chicken wings.”\\n\\n“I apologize, we don’t have chicken wings, might I suggest X or Y appetizer? We also have Z chicken entree which would be the closest thing to chicken wings, and is an excellent sharing option.”\\n\\nBlank stare. \\n\\nOther friend-“She just wants something fast.”\\n\\nI explain our from scratch kitchen, how all of our appetizers take as long or longer than the entrees. (Yes, even a well done steak)\\n\\nI offered to bring extra bread, and again repeated the order. Decided on entrees only and extra bread. \\n\\nI brought two portions of bread. “Here you are, our (restaurant name) freshly baked bread and whipped butter.” Our bread looks like bread. There is no mistaking for anything else. \\n\\nThe table looks at me aghast and confused, like I messed something up.\\n\\n“This is bread?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“So, this is bread?”\\n\\n“Yes, it is our baked in house bread.”\\n\\n“At (popular restaurant) they have XYZ bread and served with oil. Why is this your bread? It’s not XYZ bread.”\\n\\n“You are right, it is different bread. I would be happy to bring you olive oil for dipping. Would you like olive oil?”\\n\\n“No… are you sure you don’t have (other restaurant’s) bread?”\\n\\nOk, if you want their bread maybe go there?\\n\\n“Yes, I am sure I don’t. I apologize. Is there anything else I can bring for you at the moment?”\\n\\n“No…” filled with disappointment and confusion. \\n\\n\\n\\n30-40 minutes later, a food runner finds me with BlahBlah Filet in hand. “Table 77 said they didn’t order this.” \\n\\nI go up to the table. \\n\\n“You ordered the BlahBlah Filet, cooked well done, correct.”\\n\\n“Yes I want the BlahBlah Filet.”\\n\\n“Ok. Here is your BlahBlah Filet.”\\n\\n“Nonono, that is not the BlahBlah Filet. It doesn’t have the (she then describes a completely different steak with other garnishes and sides. Sides that we don’t carry.)”\\n\\n“I see. I apologize that the BlahBlah filet was not you had envisioned, however this restaurant does not have the meal you described. Would you like to enjoy this meal, or order something else from our menu.”\\n\\n“Yes. I want the BlahBlah Filet.”\\n\\nMy brain is melting. I feel like I’m losing my grip on reality. Am I not communicating properly? Why are me and this table not living in the same reality? What is happening?\\n\\n“This is the BlahBlah Filet.” I say, gesturing to the plate in front of her. \\n\\n“Oh, no… it’s not.”\\n\\nAfter a few back and forths, she decided she did not want the BlahBlah Filet, or to order anything else. She sat and watched her friend eat her dinner is record time. Chicken wing lady was really hungry. \\n\\nI drop off the check, process the card, easy. When I see she has finished signing it, I go back to the table and ask “I can take the check presenter if you are all set with it.”\\n\\nShe then hands me her untouched still folded cloth napkin. To her credit both are black and rectangular. But there is definitely a texture and weight and material difference you would immediately notice. \\n\\n“I can clear this napkin for you, but may I have the check presenter?”\\n\\n“I just gave it to you.” She has no malice or anger in her voice. I double checked and nope it was a napkin. \\n\\nI eventually got the check, tipped 15% which was honestly better than I hoped. They left their jacket, and no surprises here, the tags were still on. OF COURSE they are the type of people who wear things and return them. \\n\\nThe whole thing just left me exasperated and bewildered. It completely drained my social and emotional battery. I felt like Kate McKinnon in the re-enactment of Gaslight skit, where he’s like “This is a steak.” And she’s like “Uh, I’m pretty sure it’s a pineapple.”\\n\\nTLDR - Yes you have to pay for stuff.', 't2_4o2ap2xy', '“If I order a glass of wine, do I pay for it?”- a tale of the table that made me question reality', 't3_xjc7fx', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/xjc7fx/if_i_order_a_glass_of_wine_do_i_pay_for_it_a_tale/'), ('12eig0e', '2023-Apr-07 06:42', 'explainlikeimfive', 't5_2sokd', 'i need to know. like why do they bump inwards at the bottom of the bottle?', 't2_4x3ojun1', 'eli5 why do wine bottles do that little indent at the bottom of the bottle', 't3_12eig0e', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/12eig0e/eli5_why_do_wine_bottles_do_that_little_indent_at/'), ('woinnx', '2022-Aug-14 17:29', 'WatchPeopleDieInside', 't5_3h4zq', '', 't2_7byhyekq', \"She just paid for a wine party and she can't even drink any of the wine\", 't3_woinnx', 'https://gfycat.com/consideratenauticalelkhound'), ('147s41w', '2023-Jun-12 12:07', 'WTF', 't5_2qh61', '', 't2_6ind28ep', 'Man gets bashed in the head with a wine bottle', 't3_147s41w', 'https://v.redd.it/avrezzkwcm5b1'), ('106sjnd', '2023-Jan-08 13:57', 'CasualUK', 't5_3j2jr', '', 't2_hnz21y96', 'Is drinking 2 bottles of wine an unacceptable amount to drink on a Sunday?

I was raised to bring something with me when going to someones house for a gathering, so I brought a nice-ish ($25) bottle of wine with me. \\n\\nWhen I got there multiple people approached me and asked me why I would bring such cheap wine when the parents of the host owned a vineyard.

Strap in guys, this is a wild ride in which I did THE THING that got me banned from any of her family functions. (Plus a few threats of dismemberment and bodily harm)\\n\\nA good friend of mine from university was getting married! They had been a couple since Junior year of college, through her 2 years in the peace corps and currently her return to this continent. 6 years in total. She had been to all manner of family functions and always came back with a strange story about how she thinks her MIL secretly hates her. But she being a very quiet and sweet person pushed those thoughts aside.\\n\\nPoint 1: She is vegetarian and jewish, husband is not. She was invited and went to Christmas dinner and figured she would just eat sides, as well she brought a vegetarian casserole. MIL, after knowing her for THREE years, and being told by husband a few weeks before about not to forget friend doesn\\'t eat meat...proceeded to put meat in every dish. Friend drank water and ate her casserole the whole night while MIL cried to everyone that friend was so rude for not eating her cooking.\\n\\nAnyway, back to the story. A few friends and I were asked to be in the wedding. Friend has a HUGE family and so this was not going to be a small affair. Neither of them is particularly religious, but friend said it was would be nice to be married under a hoopa. (Think an arbor but 4 poles and covered with a white cloth and lots of flowers) Husband said he could care less, and told her to go and rent one for the wedding.\\n\\nI was at the bridal shower when MIL found out the \"pretty canopy\" was actually a hoopa. She almost lost her shit in front of a bunch of people, but managed to compose herself and laugh angrily that \"if the jews were being represented so would the catholics.\" In my head I heard a record screech, guys... they aren\\'t catholic.\\n\\nSo after much fighting, a lot of screaming, crying, threatening to pull money (which is funny because she contributed nothing), MIL lost. The boot was firmly placed, and nothing was moving it. Hoopa yes, catholic priest no.\\n\\nThings got stupid quiet, my friend texts me the night before the wedding that she has a bad feeling. I tell her it\\'s probably just nerves, she is getting married and this is a big deal! Oh how wrong I was.\\n\\nWe all show up, get our hair and makeup done. Slip into our bridesmaid dresses and hang out waiting for the bride to be finished with her hair. She makes a comment saying she hadn\\'t seen MIL all day and that she skipped her hair and makeup appointment. We all side eyed each other, took a few sips of wine and hoped the eerie feeling would go away.\\n\\n30 minutes later as we are helping the bride into her dress; guess who shows up. If you guessed MIL, you win a cookie! Flushed from coming up the stairs, (she is not a light woman) in full hair and makeup...and a white dress. Not ivory, not cream, full snow-fucking-white. The dress was clearly a wedding dress; it was even from David\\'s Bridal (which she would later shout at me). Floor length satin with a sweet heart beaded top, a bit of a train and off white lace on the bottom. The dress was even tailored to her, this has been a long con she has orchestrated.\\n\\nThe bride burst into tears and aunts and friends ushered MIL out. We did our best to console the bride, touched up her makeup, and I made her a promise that the dress would never be seen in a photo. She looked me dead in the eye and nodded. The game was on.\\n\\nThe venue only supplied white wine and champagne for the wedding party. But I grabbed my purse and ran down into the reception area and managed to flag an attendant by the bar and bribe him with a cool 20$ to give me a bottle of red early. I cracked the baby open, filled a solo cup to the brim with it and stalked outside. After a few swigs from the bottle for courage, I went over to where everyone was getting ready to take photos.\\n\\nWith one last hard stare at my friend, I got her nod of approval. I pulled out my phone, held it in front of my face like I was reading a text and walked straight into MIL. I poured the entire cup of red wine down the front of her dress, jumped back and gasped.\\n\\nThe look on her face was murderous. She screamed, yelled, threatened, and promised she would sue me. People had to hold her back because she wanted to fight me. Eventually she switched from screaming to sobbing and sank to the ground and threw a tantrum on the floor. Everyone moved back and just let her go at it and walked away to go take photos. It was surreal, as if everyone just hit their limit and noped out from around her. The 12 year old flower girl whipped out her phone and snapped a few photos much to our amusement.\\n\\nThis is already super long, but I will say that MIL went home and changed (only 20 min from venue) into a nice dark green too small and low cut dress. Because of this she missed all of the photos.\\n\\nWedding was beautiful; I got death glares from everyone she told that I attacked her with wine. No fucks were given as I drank and danced with friends. Bride thanked me in secret and 3 months later took me to the spa for a day of pampering. But I am officially \"that ISIS cunt\" to MIL, and I\\'ll take it with pride.\\n\\n**EDIT: You guys are awesome! Someone gave me gold?! WINE FOR ALL! In all seriousness, I\\'m glad you all enjoyed this story. I am not a super hero but I am a woman who has been kicked around a lot due to ethnicity by this MIL and had zero fucks left to give. Lone Ranger style my fight or flight reaction is permanently stuck on fight. The couple has been NC for the last year and half since the wedding.**\\n\\nEdit.2: HOLY WAFFLES THIS BLEW UP\\n\\nEdit.3: RIP my inbox! I\\'m trying to grant you all your cookies!

NC from the moment that wedding ended has been absolute bliss for my friends.\\n\\nThis past weekend was my gal pal’s birthday. And she decided why not have a brunch on Easter on her badass rooftop in the city. So I fired up my cooking skills and make my famous vegetarian, crispy, turmeric, saffron Persian rice with roasted almonds and pomegranate seeds. (Tahdig for all my desert brothers and sisters out here)\\n\\nWhat does this lovely brunch have to do with my sister from another mister’s MIL she has been NC with for almost 2ish years? I’m glad you asked llamas. Because bitch showed up. I’m not sure who’s Facebook she stalked, or what person she water boarded but she came from out of state and showed up at the front door of their apartment building.\\n\\nI will rewind just a little. Friend and I are setting up on the roof, tossing pillows on the outdoor furniture and laying out some linens on the tables. Their apartment building is only 4 stories high, live on the top floor and are the only apartment with roof access. Because we were not sure that people would hear the buzzer inside of the apartment we put a sign for people to ring the bell and give a shout up to the roof (or text) and we would buzz them in.\\n\\nSo I’m meandering about fluffing pillows while happily balancing my mimosa when I hear someone yelling. I figured someone came early and friend went to go lean over the rood edge to see who it was. She immediate reeled back and spun to look at me. “It’s (name redacted)!!” She shouted as she ran for the apartment to stop the hubs from accidently buzzing her in.\\n\\nI peeked over the roof and watched her for a bit. Pacing, freaking out, pulling on the handle of the door. She hit the buzzer maybe 10 times and then looked up and saw me. She was… angry. Flipped me off and went back to tried to yank on the handle and shout something about wanting to give her baby his Easter basket. The woman seemed unhinged. She was in fact carrying one those drug store giant plastic green baskets filled with crap so high to was wrapped in plastic.\\n\\nSo I did what any sane person would do, just parked myself there and sipped my mimosa watching her lose her shit and occasionally look up at me and shake her fist. Friend came back with husband and he peeked over to see her pacing like a damn hyena in front of the door. Since people would be arriving soon they worried she would force her way in with others. I posted on the Facebook group a quick rundown on what was happening, so people knew what they were possibly walking into. MIL then had a brilliant idea. She buzzed ALL of the other apartments, hoping someone might let her in, while she continued to call out for her son who at this point was hiding on the roof drinking straight out of the bottle of champagne.\\n\\nSomeone let the bitch in. She charged into the building and at this point friend’s husband whipped out his phone and dialed 911. He said and I quote “My unstable mother I haven’t spoken to in 2 years traveled across the country and showed up at my apartment screaming. She just broke in to the building and we are scared she is a danger to us and herself. We live XXX.” I’m pretty sure by the time this “I have bad knees and a thyroid problem” lady made it up the stairs to the 4th floor the cops were rolling up.\\n\\nShe never made it inside the apartment. When the cops confronted her she turned sickeningly sweet and begged them while she fake cried to see her baby. She tried to get the cops on her side to talk to him about going with her. Cops were having none of it and asked her if she was invited here and if she knew she was trespassing. Husband went out and told the police he wanted her to leave. This is where shit hit the fan. She lunged for her son and threw the basket at the police and tried to drag husband down the stairs. When he pulled away, she decided to just make a run for it. One of the cops grabbed her arm as she started down the stairs, which threw her off balance and she took the cop tumbling down a flight of stairs with her.\\n\\nThere were plastic toys, candy and that crinkly cellophane crap all over the hall and down the stairs. Watching her be put into handcuffs face down in all of was fairly amusing. Friend and I sipped our mimosas from the top of the rail. Trespassing, assault, assault of an office and two more charges are pending. It was a lovely brunch though.\\n\\n**Edit: Recipe Tax**\\n\\n    3 cups basmati or jasmine rice\\n    4 ½ cups cold water\\n    1 ½ tsp kosher salt\\n    4 TBSP ghee or clarified butter\\n    ⅓ cup plain yogurt\\n    1 egg yolk\\n    1 tsp saffron\\n    1 tsp turmeric\\n    4 TBSP ghee or clarified butter\\n    2 TBSP vegetable oil\\n    1 cup toasted slivered almonds\\n    ½ cup pomegranate seeds\\n    \\n    Add 3 cups of basmati rice to a nonstick 4-Qt pot. (Enameled dutch oven is the jam) Wash the rice with cold water, drain and repeat 2 more times. Drain as much of the water as possible.\\n    Add 4½ cups of cold water, 1½ teaspoons kosher salt, and 4 tablespoons ghee or clarified butter. Cover the pot and bring it to a boil over medium heat. Reduce the heat to medium low and continue cooking for about 10 minutes, or until all of the water has been cooked off. Remove from the heat.\\n    Transfer the par cooked rice to a shallow container and set aside. You will use the same pot to steam the Kateh. Now make the tahdig: Add one egg yolk, ⅓ cup yogurt, saffron and turmeric to a medium bowl. Whisk gently until combined. Use a large spoon to fold in 1 cup of the par cooked rice that is in the shallow container.\\n    In the same pot heat 4 tablespoons ghee and 2 tablespoons vegetable oil over medium low heat, until it sizzles.\\n    Add the yogurt and rice mixture to the pot and spread evenly to cover the bottom of the pot.\\n    Mix in the almonds to the remaining rice and add it to the pot and level off the top and gently pat down with the back of the spoon. (The reason I don\\'t add the almonds in for the rice that is going to be crisped on the bottom, is that the almonds can burn and become bitter)\\n    Cover the lid with a damkesh or a large kitchen towel. Steam over medium low heat for 45 minutes to one hour.\\n    To serve, remove the lid, place a large serving platter over the pot. Hold the platter and the pot handles and invert the rice onto the platter.\\n    Pile pomegranate seeds in the center and some leftover almonds (or parsley) and serve! We eat it as a meal but you can roast chicken or lamb on the side. It pairs well with runny yolk fried eggs.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nRed Wine Girl and the Adventures with Crazy Bitch(https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/8jpd2q/red_wine_girl_and_the_adventures_with_crazy_bitch/) Posted on May 15, 2018\\n\\nAlright party people, this Crazy Bitch MIL needs a name since she apparently isn’t going anywhere. I am writing on behalf of my ultimate bestie who is reddit (and computer) illiterate.\\n\\nBitch bot will let you in on the juicy details, but yes. I am ‘That Red Wine Bitch’.\\n\\nAnyway, so I guess you are all wondering why I called you here. When we last left off Crazy Bitch MIL was booked for assault on Easter Sunday, after showing up from a few states away and 2 years of NC. She did not post bail and sat in jail until her court date a few days ago. In which a sympathetic judge ignored testimony from the son AND the police officer. Her charges were reduced and she was let go after having to pay a pretty hefty trespassing fee and being told she had to keep her nose clean for a year.\\n\\nSo she then saw the error of her ways and pranced home. Yea. Fucking. Right.\\n\\nLet me set the scene, Mother’s Day, 2018. Sunny, warm, with a hint of coastal breeze to make the weather perfect. Friend’s mother lives across the country so they decided to join our friends group at an outdoor event with sunshine, beats, picnic food and booz. We all had a wonderful time on my side of the pond.\\n\\nThey left to head home and a few hours later I received a very disturbing phone call from friend. Apparently Crazy Bitch MIL was staking out their apartment. She rented a studio a block away and just so happened to ‘run in’ to them when they were coming home. She was apparently upset that her son didn’t call her for Mother’s Day and wanted to let him know she officially moved here. Even though she literally owns a home in another state! She decided to rent an apartment in one of the most expensive cities in the country.\\n\\nFriend is disturbed, and husband is in shock. He started paperwork on an RO and they got a RING cam just in case. I invited them to stay at my place, because apparently when friend left for work on Monday and Tuesday morning she saw Crazy Bitch MIL sitting in the café across the street reading the paper. Husband has been working from home and trying to figure out alternative ways out of his building.\\n\\nHe called some other cousins, aunts and uncles and told them what was going on. They are apparently not shocked. She had been planning this sudden move for YEARS. Spoke non-stop about her son and ME but never mentioned friend beyond making a face at her name. They never thought she would go through with it, and said she disappeared a week before Easter/never showed up to the family dinner. Bitch MIL is stalking me. Awesome. I expect two homeland security guys at my door soon enough. Sigh\\n\\nFriend and Husband are coming over tomorrow to stay for who knows how long. They alerted their landlord who is at least taking the matter seriously and passed out fliers to the other tenants with her name and photo saying she was banned from the building. He is also going to keep an eye on the camera footage by the main door to make sure she doesn’t slip in with deliveries. He’s a great guy, I’m going to send him some cookies.\\n\\nThere you have it. I’m gearing up for guests and possibly a cash me outside moment with Crazy Bitch MIL.\\n\\n**Ramadan Mubarak!**\\n\\n**Persian Recipe Tax: Nan e Nokhodchi**\\n\\n    1/2 cup vegetable oil\\n    3/4 cup confectioners’ sugar, sifted\\n    1 teaspoon finely ground cardamom\\n    1/2 tablespoon rose water (if you can get edible rose petals, those too!)\\n    1 and 3/4 cups fine chickpea flour (roasted if you can find it)\\n    2-3 tablespoons chopped or ground pistachios\\n    Combine the oil, sugar, cardamom and rose water in bowl. Using a hand mixer, mix on medium for 2-3 minutes until light and creamy.\\n    Sift chickpea flour into the bowl and beat on low for 1 minute until the dough is no longer sticky.\\n    Dust your work surface with some chickpea flour and knead the dough for 10 minutes until it is more workable. The dough is very crumbly.\\n    Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and set aside for 2 hours. Do not refrigerate.\\n    Preheat oven to 300 F and line baking tray with parchment paper.\\n    Roll out the dough on a dusted work surface until it is 3/4-inch thick. Cut out cookies using a 1-inch clover-shaped cookie cutter and place the cookies on the baking tray, spaced 1 inch apart. Re-roll and repeat until all the dough is used up.\\n    Sprinkle chopped pistachios on top of each cookie.\\n    Place cooking tray in middle rack and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until the cookies turn a light golden colour.\\n    Remove cookies from oven and let it cool on tray for a few minutes. Then carefully transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Be careful when you transfer the cookies as they crumble very easily.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nRedWhine, Ramadan and the Pork Chop(https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/8lwfnx/redwhine_ramadan_and_the_pork_chop/) Posted on May 24, 2018\\n\\nHey party people.\\n\\nIf you have followed the shenanigans thus far you will know that RedWhine, (Thanks for the name u/clumber ) the crazy MIL that reappeared after 2-ish years of NC to throw metaphorical sugar in my friends gas tank of life.\\n\\nFriend and husband spent a few quiet days at my house across the pond and eventually went back last Sunday. They have been leaving and going through a back exit that their landlord gave them a key to. For a little update, the RO paperwork is in, family has been called to get her ass back to bullshit land and now we just… wait. I appreciate all of the comments here and the people who offered sound advice, my friend and her husband followed a lot of it.\\n\\nMy juicy, hilarious and absolutely amazing tidbit for you all actually has to do with me! God I hate love this woman. So it’s Ramadan, and I’m on my fasting game. (Having weird fried chicken dreams) Headed over the pond yesterday to a fast breaking party called Iftar, which is when we are allowed to eat after sunset. Two other people headed to the party and I waited on the corner down from friend’s apartment building. We chatted, showed some memes and waited for them to come meet us.\\n\\nSuddenly I feel this tap on my shoulder. When I turn around I am met with a fried pork chop a few inches from my nose. (It’s kind of a sail on my face) Confusion, more confusion, sudden recognition that RedWhine was standing there holding a pork chop at me. She then starts to gesture WITH the pork chop. “You think you can just corrupt my son?! This COUNTRY?”\\n\\nShe pointed the pork chop at me as the two friends I’m with start giggling behind me. And just for reference, they are two hijabis (kind of a slang we call young fashionable women in hijab) and I am not. I am the waist length wild curly hair trying to eat my head person.\\n\\nI pointed at the pork chop and asked why she had it. To which she responded she was waiting for me. UGH… GUYS…. There it totally a leak somewhere! She knew about the time of the Iftar party and was walking around trying to find us with a fucking pork chop!\\n\\nHijabi 1 asked RedWhine if she was going to eat it, because she was hungry. Which seemed to piss her off since she yelled that she KNEW we didn’t eat pork! At this point I’m DYING; I have that ugly holding back laughter but not breathing face on.\\n\\nFriend and husband come jogging up as she’s lecturing my hijabi friends on their own religion. Something something Trump, deported, and god’s wrath for non believers. (You have to take this crap with a grain of salt) Husband gets between us and is yelling at RedWhine to leave and we all make a hasty exit down the road.\\n\\nI’m walking backwards watching her flail this pork chop around and point it in her sons face. And finally I just can’t hold it and laugh, full belly absolutely cannot hold it back anymore laugh. She points the pork chop over his shoulder at me and WHINES that he is hanging out with terrorists and she can protect him. (Apparently with her pork chop saber!) Husband pulls out his phone and says he’s calling the police, and like fucking smoke she disappears in the other direction. Glorious. Apparently she was telling him to come with her back home, that her sister was coming to get them (her) from our city of Sin and terrorists.\\n\\nWe sat at dinner, stuffed our faces and regaled the other party goers of RedWhine the crazy lady who tried to ward us off like vampires with a pork cross.\\n\\n**Lamb Tagine**\\n\\n    1 tbsp olive oil and 1 tbsp butter\\n    2 tbsp blanched almond slivers\\n    2 red onions diced\\n    3 cloves garlic smashed and diced\\n    2 tbsp ginger paste\\n    pinch of saffron threads\\n    2 cinnamon sticks\\n    2 tsp coriander seeds crushed\\n    1 lb lamb cubed shoulder or leg\\n    8 dates seeded\\n    8 apricots\\n    4 strips of orange peel\\n    2 tbsp honey\\n    1/2 tsp of Ras el Hanout (optional) (This is a moroccan spice blend)\\n    kosher salt and fresh cracked black pepper\\n    Instructions\\n    Heat the butter and oil in a tagine or heavy casserole baking dish. Stir in the almonds and sauté until golden. Add the diced onions and garlic, stir and cook over low heat until golden. Stir in the ginger paste, saffron, cinnamon sticks and coriander seeds. Add the cubed lamb pieces and stir to make sure everything is coated with the onion and spices. Sauté for 4 minutes.\\n    Next pour enough water in to cover the meat and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat, cover and simmer for 1 hour or until meat is tender.\\n    Add the dates, apricots and orange peel, stir to mix and cover. Simmer for 20 minutes.\\n    Stir in the honey and ras-el-hanout (optional) and simmer another 10 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. The sauce should be syrupy.

RedWhine has left the city!(https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/92h0we/rejoice_pork_chop_wielding_army_redwhine_has_left/) Posted on July 27, 2018\\n\\nThis update is… interesting. Friend’s husband called me up a few days ago to sincerely apologize to me for what happened. (for the 100th time) He told me that the very next day she showed up to his apartment and slipped in with the postmaster. He got home from work to find her sitting on his floor a hysterical mess. Mascara running down her face, dirty, crazy hair and smeared lipstick mess. He found out then that she hadn’t actually been paying rent for a place to stay here and had instead been staying at a weekly pay motel. (Which she had not paid in some time and was kicked out) She was broke, homeless and firmly believed the terrorists were after her.\\n\\nWithout a beat he called the police and she was taken to lock up. He then called as many family members as he could to tell them she had a psychotic break and someone needed to pick her up. Only her sister showed up the next day and finally took her home. But she does back to come back in 3 months for her hearing of not keeping her god damn nose clean. (harassment and stalking charges) BUT!!!! The judge this time granted the RO. Glory!! Praise be, we have appeased the wine gods!\\n\\nHe has only heard snippets from family members, but she seems to be absolutely off the deep end. She is telling anyone that will listen that her trip to our city was AMAZING. She had such a good time. She spent so much time with her son…bonding. But the city was too big! And loud! And scary! So she just had to go home. And that one day soon her son (apparently told her) that he was going to go home too haha…. No.\\n\\nThey added a few more security measures and have returned to some semblance of normal. I feel awful for my friend and her husband, because there is this part of me that worries that this woman will never leave them alone until she’s dead or in jail.

Leave the marinated chicken out at room temperature for about 45 minutes before grilling.\\n    Prepare the outdoor grill for high heat because this Chicken Kabob needs to cook fast otherwise it will dry out. If using coals, they should be burned until they are covered with a white ash before grilling. The grill grates should be 4-5 inches above the heat source.\\n    Use narrow metal skewers to skewer the Chicken Kabobs. Skewer the tomatoes, onions and peppers separately because these vegetables do not cook at the same time. Spray or brush the skewered vegetables with a light coating of olive oil and a sprinkle of salt and pepper before grilling them.\\n    Place two metal bars (I purchased mine from hardware store) at top and bottom of the grill grate and rest the tip and handle of the skewers on the bars so the chicken and vegetables don\\'t touch the grates.\\n    If there is not enough space on the grill for all the skewers, grill the vegetables first and keep them warm until you grill the chicken.\\n    Grill the Jujeh Kabob over high heat. As soon as one side starts changing color the other sides should be grilled so the hot fire seals in the juices. Then keep turning the skewers until golden brown on all sides and no longer pink inside. Check one piece of the Jujeh kabob by cutting through it with a knife, if it is white and juicy it is ready. Remove the kabobs that are ready from fire and keep them warm under aluminum foil and serve as soon as all are done grilling.\\n    Enjoy the Chicken Kabobs and grilled vegetables over Sangak (Persian flat bread) or Persian rice. If you are serving the chicken kabobs with white rice, add a dab of softened butter on top and toss gently with a fork to coat the warm rice, and sprinkle it with sumac for the traditional style. Serve the kabobs with extra lemon/lime wedges with a few wedges of fresh white or red onions.\\n\\nMarked as concluded as OOP hasn\\'t commented on this account since 2020.', 't2_4ya5abuf', 'The saga of Red Wine Girl and an unhinged MIL, seasoned with tasty recipes.', 't3_131ileq', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/131ileq/the_saga_of_red_wine_girl_and_an_unhinged_mil/'), ('zcfm9v', '2022-Dec-04 11:25', 'science', 't5_mouw', '', 't2_l1ket', 'Despite conclusive research that shows that all alcoholic beverages, including wine, increase the risk of many types of cancer, Americans demonstrated low awareness of this risk, and some perceived alcohol as having health benefits', 't3_zcfm9v', 'https://www.aacr.org/about-the-aacr/newsroom/news-releases/few-americans-are-aware-of-links-between-alcohol-and-cancer-risk/'), ('typqo8', '2022-Apr-07 18:25', 'Teachers', 't5_2qqcs', 'Having a rough week, trying to take a breather.

English is my first language so tell me off for spelling or grammar mistakes!\\n\\nWhen we met my (35M) girlfriend (29F) was very shy and self-conscious. Over the last 2.5 years I’ve really helped her get over that. A lot. She’s gone from telling me I’d never see her fully naked to regularly asking me to top up her glass of wine in the bath (we live together). Like sometimes twice per bath, and she has a bath almost every day. It’s become a very flirty moment for us as she makes a big deal of showing off.\\n\\nIt’s something that’s started over the last few months. Due to her PCOs she skipped a few periods. And today she got her first one in four months. So it’s the first time she’s been on her period since she started asking me to come in and top up her wine.\\n\\nSo she casually asked me to come and top up her wine in the bath like always. But I got a bit freaked out and didn’t want to go in there and see her in the bath whilst on her period. Maybe I’m old fashioned or something but I’m just not comfortable seeing it. I know a lot about it and talk about it with her and give her ice cream or cuddles or whatever she needs on her period.\\n\\nFor context the conversation went (via mobile as I was gaming):\\n\\nHer: fancy topping me up and checking me out?\\n\\nMe: er... are you sure...?\\n\\nHer: yeah, why not?\\n\\nMe: because your on your period, isn’t that gross and stuff? And a bit weird?\\n\\nHer: oh sorry. I didn’t think. Sorry for being a weirdo.\\n\\nMe: nothing to be sorry about it’s just a weird thought. If you want me to I will though?\\n\\nHer: no that’s ok. Forget it.\\n\\nMe: I’m happy to if you want me to.\\n\\nHer: ok it’s safe for you to come in now.\\n\\nBut here’s where I may be an asshole, she apologised a lot as she hadn’t thought of that. Then I told her it’s fine and if she’s ok with it I’ll still come in and top her up, I don’t want to make her self conscious again or upset etc. But she agreed only when she had a towel covering herself in the bath. She was upset as well. \\n\\nReddit AITA for not wanting to top up her wine in the bath when on her period and making her self-conscious again and upset?\\n\\nEdit: reading this again the next day I wrote it poorly.

Today being Valentine’s Day, I made reservations for a course meal at a hotel restaurant.\\n\\nAdmittedly, it’s not my usual style; I’m perfectly happy going to cheap izakayas and that kind of thing, but variety is the spice of life and we both decided it would be nice to dress up a little and have a fancy meal.\\n\\nTwo course meals were already going to set me back a pretty penny, but the fuck up was when it came time to order drinks. As befits a romantic dinner, we decided on a bottle of wine. I have long since decided not to pretend to be a wine expert and to just ask the servers for their recommendation when it comes to this kind of thing. Our waiter went for the drink menu, came back with a tablet, and made a few suggestions, all around the ¥16,000 ($160) price range. Of course I tried not to let it show, but I thought that was a bit on the expensive side and swiped to an $80 alternative. I asked him if it’s a good wine.\\n\\n“Oh, that’s a very good wine, sir.”\\n\\nI told him we’d go with that one, and he politely took the order and left. My girlfriend spent the next 10 minutes or so joking about the wine ordering process, and I thought she was making fun of me for going with a cheaper wine. Fair enough.\\n\\nThe wine was served to us and we both agreed it was really good.\\n\\nShe kept going with the joking, though, and it was when she said that she hoped that it was 80,000 yen and not 80,000 dollars that it finally hit me. Somehow, even after living here for as long as I have, my brain misfired and I equated 80,000 yen with $80 when it’s actually more like $800.\\n\\nBy that point, we were well into the bottle and there was no going back.\\n\\nNeedless to say, that was a shocker, but I did my best to take it in stride and just enjoy it. She was pretty cool about it too, laughing about it but also showing concern about the (for us) outrageous price. I’m fortunate enough to not have to worry about it, and I’m thankful for that, but my bank account definitely took a hit tonight. I had to mentally prepare myself for when the bill arrived.\\n\\nAnyway, as I told her, we’ll just be drinking tap water for the next 10 Valentine’s Days.\\n\\nTL;DR - During Valentine’s dinner, messed up the yen-dollar exchange rate in my head and ordered a $800 wine at a restaurant instead of an $80 one.\\n\\n\\nEdit: Well this gained traction while I was sleeping.

Mum wanted me raised to not be a stereotypical British teenager sneaking out lying about going to a mates house and passing out from drinking vodka in a field, so she got me drinking tiny amounts of wine at dinner time from the age of 5/6. We\\'re talking a shot of wine, no more. They learned their lesson after I got shitfaced aged 5 off of brandy (story in the comments).\\n\\nMe being autistic got super into this and wanted to try all the different red wines we had, and I asked lots of questions. It became a little special interest of mine when I was 8. For those who are unfamiliar, if you\\'re not baptised into the church as a baby, you can do a combo baptism/first holy communion as a kid through Catholic school. I did this in primary school so I would have a place at the best secondary school in my city, which happened to be Catholic.\\n\\nLike weddings, you have a dress rehearsal for the first holy communion, with the priest. It\\'s a whole goddamn mass, except instead of 300 people in the bigass church, it\\'s the 10 or 20 people in the ceremony and family/godparents to be as well. So being a dress rehearsal, there\\'s a full communion with the wine and wafers to be Top Lad Jesus\\' blood and body.\\n\\nI was doing so good at being a normal kid during the ceremony until this part. Then it was Special Interest Activation Mode. See the priest doesn\\'t really expect kids having communion to drink the wine, they expect you to hold the goblet and give it back. Well, not me, and not this time - I swirled that goblet, sniffed it, said \"wait this is familiar\", had a sip, SHRIEKED, and turned to my parents jumping yelling \"MUM, DAD, THIS IS BLOSSOM HILL! IT\\'S THAT GRENACHE WE HAD LAST WEEK!!\"\\n\\nMy parents have never been so fucking humiliated in their lives. We bailed the rehearsal, was told to be silent during the real one, and shortly moved churches. I think the priest thought I had the devil in me and was some alcoholic kid, because the bastard tried to drown me during the official baptism and there\\'s a video of me coughing my guts up lmao.\\n\\nTl;dr: my parents got me an autistic kid to develop a special interest in wine which bit them in the ass when I got baptised and had my first communion at church.\\n\\n---‐‐------------\\n\\nEDIT: Due to a comment bug the brandy story is an addendum here.\\n\\nBrandy story:\\n\\nWhen I was 5, I kept getting recurrent bronchitis. It lasted over 6 months, the antibiotics just weren\\'t curing it and they had to keep getting stronger ones.\\n\\nIt tasted of fake banana and the texture of it was giving me autistic meltdowns. My dad could not rationalise a 5 year old to keep taking the antibiotics so he started experimenting to try and make it palatable.\\n\\nFirst he added sugar. Still gross. Then fruit squash. Still gross. Tried another batch with fruit juice. Even worse.\\n\\nAt this point he was losing the will to live and probably losing interest in me living and so desperate times call for desperate measures.

The first night I did he said “Congratulations. What’re we celebrating?” And I said “Nothing, just unwinding.” He seemed uncomfortable and I noticed we never overlapped during dinner again, but at the time didn’t think much of it at all. Never occurred to me it was intentional. \\n\\nFast forward to today. He said “I don’t tell many people this but I have a drinking problem, I haven’t touched a drink in 6 years, but every day is still an active choice to do so, and I’m sorry but I cannot take being in the house with your liquor cabinet and wine drinking every day. Could you move some of this stuff out of the apartment like to a friend’s place or I’ll pay for storage.” \\n\\nI told him I’d have to think about it. I was leaning towards saying I can keep the liquor in my room as a middle ground. I want to be supportive and everything. But I’m not a heavy drinker at all. I really like unwinding at the end of the day. And I feel like if he needed this accommodation he should’ve said something at the outset. Now we share a house. \\n\\nBut I also get for him it’s a medical condition he’s fighting and for me it’s just a recreational preference.

While this was most certainly NOT planned we were both over the moon excited with the news. We both have very well paying stable jobs and had often discussed beginning a family in the near future. My girlfriend has been pretty consistently happy throughout the pregnancy. She has a few bad days but we get through it together. \\n\\nSo fast forward to about 2 weeks ago. Me and my girlfriend had invited some friends over for dinner but as we got closer to the evening she claimed she didn’t feel well and would rather lay down. I was very understanding and so was everyone else, after all she is growing a tiny human. Now this is where I caught wind something might be up. Throughout dinner I would periodically return to the kitchen to make drinks and left the bottles of booze out on the counter to return to our liquor pantry later. I kept noticing some of the bottles looked noticeably emptier than last time I used them but I ignored it. A few times I thought I heard my girlfriend walking around but assumed if she wanted to be social she would be. Dinner came to an end and I saw our friends out. I returned to the kitchen and was absolutely certain the bottle of gin looked touched from where I left it. I got a really bad gut feeling and walked towards the bedroom me and girlfriend share. I walked in and she was out cold, I came closer and she immediately smelled like booze. I looked around and found a cup with melted ice and leftover gin hidden under the bed. I was floored. Admittedly I reacted badly, and I woke up her yelling at her about how she could be so stupid to drink while she was pregnant. What was even more sickening to me was how little my girlfriend seemed to care she had been caught drinking. \\n\\nAfter a lengthy argument I found out she has been using booze to help her sleep at night because she’s struggling to get comfortable. She has also been socially drinking while out sometimes as her pregnancy isn’t always noticeable under a baggy hoodie or jacket. Most of all she made it clear she doesn’t plan on stopping and she does not believe alcohol affects the baby as bad as everyone says. I went full control mode. I went out the next day and bought a lock for our liquor pantry that only I know the combination to. Every time my wife goes out now I check her phone to see where she is and if she is at a restaurant or bar I text her or whoever she is with saying not to drink any alcohol (she has yet to tell some of her friends and family we are expecting). I also told her if I catch her with anymore alcohol I will be telling her OBGYN and her family. She says I am overreacting and being a complete asshole.

He replaced it yet again, then last night started drinking it. So I mixed the rest of it how I liked with my melon liquer and malibu, figuring he wouldn't touch it like that.\\n\\n\\nI was right, he wouldn't touch it like that, but he was pissed that I did that. He said since he bought it, he was allowed to drink it if he wanted. I guess he kind of has a point, but he bought it as a replacement to the gifted one he drank. And anyways, he tends to fall too hard into drinking when he has liquor and I don't want to deal with it honestly. The beer is bad enough to begin with. He said to mind my own business, that getting drunk has nothing to do with me and I need to stay out of it and not try to stop it and that it was wrong of me to mix the liquor to force him to stop drinking it. But it was mine, and he seriously didn't need it, he's been promising to stop the liquor or at least slow down for a while now too.

Barely over minimum wage, no insurance, no raises, no future. New store management came in, and it was clear that they were \"cleaning house\" (I.E. firing all of the old staff to hire their people). Somewhat standard, labor laws in my area allow firing for almost any reason.\\n\\nI had been down that road before. I needed a paycheck until I found a new job, so I played by their new rules. I did every stupid thing they said. I saw other, more dedicated people fall by the wayside. Eventually management needed a corporate policy violation to fire me.\\n\\nFinally, one day, they changed the time clock an hour ahead, and fired me for being one hour \"late\" to work. OK, fair play, 100% legal anyways (they paid for the total number of hours worked), they were just fabricating the lateness for company policy.\\n\\nREVENGE BEGINS After finding that they were fighting my unemployment claim, I filed a formal complaint with the liquor bureau in my state. Their clock said that i was an hour \"late\", therefore their official paperwork said that they were selling alcohol an hour after last call. Hundreds per violation, plus automatic license suspension after X violations, and every bar transaction for that hour was a possible violation.\\n\\nI QUICKLY got corporate attention. My last check was double checked for hours accuracy and overnighted to my front door. Cashier\\'s check, not standard payroll.I eventually signed a form saying that they were not selling alcohol after hours and they would stop filing frivolous appeals against my unemployment benefits.\\n\\nThe GM was replaced 2 months after I left, and they had repeated staffing problems trying to fill my shoes. Corporate still gives me a stellar job reference to this day.\\n\\nTL;DR company changes time clock ahead to fire me for being \"one hour late\", I report them to the liquor bureau for selling alcohol \"one hour after last call\"\\n\\nEDIT: Looking at the comments, I was unclear about my goals and intentions of the revenge. My goal was simply to get my unemployment paid for, and to turn the screws if they failed to do so.\\n\\nFor clarity\\'s sake, this was not daylight savings time, but it was the early 2000s when virtually all computer systems did not play nicely with each other.  For example, for daylight savings time each location would root in (# prompt at least) and change the store\\'s server clocks ahead or behind 1 hour before the business day began...or every system from payroll to card processing shat themselves and corporate hated them for a while. They could not change the clocks mid-day, they could only change it before the work day and could not alter the clocks again until close of business.\\n\\nThey also did not pay me any extra money, they only overnighted my final check to me instead of waiting 2 weeks and stopped filing appeals to my already-approved unemployment benefits; because I told the regional manager they were putting me in a tight spot financially.\\n\\nThe liquor law specifically stated that the office clock in the state main office would be considered the official clock. Legally, no violation actually occurred. I told the clerk at the liquor office the same story, and she still asked me to file a complaint so they could officially verify the story. They also got my contact info, but never called or wrote me.\\n\\n A regional boss wanted that signed form not for legal reasons or license compliance, but for internal company reasons. Upper management wanted heads to roll if anything actually risked their liquor license; but since the GM just chose a DUMBASSED way to try to validate my termination, I took my unemployment benefits and considered the matter closed.', 't2_3im0w', 'Manufacture paperwork to fire me?

Haven't finished any cig completely the last few days, always a few drags left before I run inside shivering and sniffling.\", 't2_3kp433qu', 'Kinda regretting smoking American spirits rn', 't3_z9edg1', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/Cigarettes/comments/z9edg1/kinda_regretting_smoking_american_spirits_rn/'), ('64zpii', '2017-Apr-12 12:41', 'Cigarettes', 't5_2qjd2', 'Alright. So ever since I started smoking I\\'ve basically smoked NAS. So, I\\'ve decided to give my personal opinion and ranking of every standard colour of NAS that I\\'ve tried so far. If anyone wants to share their own opinions, engage in debate, or just wants some idea of what they\\'re getting into, this is here. I\\'ll be ranking every cig on flavour, draw/body, and strength, starting with my favourite, and going down the list to my least favourite.\\n\\n1. Turquoise: The Turquoise pack has been my daily go-to since I started. It was my first cigarette, and I\\'ve smoked more turquoise spirits than any other cigarette. Like all spirits, they last forever and are incredibly strong. If my knowledge is correct they are the strongest spirits on the market. These gave me a buzz, and sometimes still do. However, the downside is that as most spirits, their draw is honestly kind of awful in comparison, they draw tight, and packing them makes it worse. So you do gotta roll them out. Just a bit. \\nFlavour: 10/10\\nStrength: 9/10\\nBody: 6/10\\n\\n2. Black: Black spirits are my usual driver right next to Turquoise. For every three or four packs of turquoise I buy, I\\'ll buy a pack of blacks. Personally, these are wonderful. The flavour is amazing and something you can\\'t get from any other cigarette. They make my tongue and lips tingle, always manage to give me a buzz, they absolutely kick my ass in the morning with coffee, and when drunk taste like heaven. Definitely a strong cig, and I go through packs of these slower than any other. I love them and highly recommend them to anyone. \\nDownsides, the biggest being how harsh and almost chemically the flavour gets during the last few drags. Once it hits that eagle symbol, it gets hot and fast. A lot of people also don\\'t like how strong they are, or the flavour, which is perfectly understandable. If these weren\\'t so strong, I would smoke these daily.\\nFlavour: 10/10\\nStrength: 10/10\\nBody: 8/10\\n\\n3. Dark Green: The full flavour menthol are probably my favourite menthol cigarette behind Newports. They\\'re rich, strong menthol, smooth, don\\'t taste like candy or toothpaste as some menthols do. Give me a great buzz, and I find have a strong body in comparison to other NAS cigs. If you like menthol, and strong smokes, get these. They\\'re basically menthol turquoise.\\nFlavour: 8/10\\nStrength: 7/10\\nBody: 9/10\\n\\n4. Brown: Honestly not much to say about these. Flavorful, but basically your standard unfiltered ciggie. Good, but nothing to scream to the heavens about in my opinion. But not bad by any means. Just not a huge fan of unfiltered. Although they do have possibly the best body on any NAS I\\'ve had\\nFlavour: 7/10\\nStrength: 8/10\\nBody: 10/10\\n\\n5. Yellows: Being the \"light\" version of NAS, these are pretty mellow, and smooth if you\\'re into that thing. I always suggest these to most people who haven\\'t had NAS before, because Turquoise and Blacks always seem to be too strong for most the first time. They\\'re an ok cig, and if my throat\\'s hurting I\\'ll definitely pick up a pack of these. An alright flavour. However, the body is pretty weak on these, and to be fair, even if the mellow flavour is alright, it\\'s still much too airy for me. These are right in the middle for me.\\nFlavour: 6/10\\nStrength: 4/10\\nBody: 5/10\\n\\n6: Celedon: I had these once at a friends home when I got super stoned. Apparently, these have a charcoal filter? I\\'m not sure. But they call these the \"Balanced taste\" cigarettes. They\\'re ok. Smooth, much like a yellow, but definitely not flavourless. A basic, middle of the road smoke for me.\\nFlavour: 5/10\\nStrength: 5/10\\nBody: 5/10\\n\\n7. Light Blues: Ah yes, the standard NAS cigarette. The flagship pack. Personally, these fall short for me. They taste chemically, just overpoweringly chemically for me. I smoked half a pack of these, and I gave the other half away. Their draw is about the same as any other, but the flavour is just, honestly bad. No other way of putting it. Honestly, wouldn\\'t recommend these to anyone.\\nFlavour: 3/10\\nStrength: 4/10\\nBody: 4/10\\n\\n8. Light green: Basically the equal to a menthol yellow. I got these twice, both times I struggled to finish the pack. I\\'m not a fan of light cigs as it is, but for some reason these just made me gag. The flavour wasn\\'t anywhere to what I wanted, and the body was so weak that there was absolutely no tobacco taste, unlike what I can get when smoking dark greens. If you like these, that\\'s fine. But in my opinion, these fall real short.\\nFlavour: 2/10\\nStrength: 2/10\\nBody 3/10\\n\\n9. Orange: Perhaps the bane of my existence. Oranges are my least favourite cigarette in the NAS lineup. Basically the \"Ultra-light\" version of NAS, (the Spirit version of Marb Silvers) these had by far the worst flavour, body, and strength of any cig I\\'ve had from NAS. It\\'s like smoking air, full air. Yellows may be light, but you can hardly taste anything with these. The draw is incredibly hard, I smoked half a pack of these with the filters, then ripped the filters in half for the rest, still couldn\\'t taste a thing. If you like ultra-lights, go for it. But as far as cigs go they\\'re a waste of money\\nFlavour: 0/10\\nStrength: 0/10\\nBody: 0/10\\n\\nAnd, for anyone wondering about colours such as Tan, Gold, Dark Blue, or Grey, Tan and Gold are pretty much the exact same as Yellows, Grey is a smoother black, and Dark blue are just US grown Turquoise. \\n\\n\\n', 't2_166r6a', 'Ranking American Spirits.', 't3_64zpii', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/Cigarettes/comments/64zpii/ranking_american_spirits/'), ('13hqctx', '2023-May-14 18:06', 'jerkbudsHentai', 't5_7frzz8', '', 't2_let7lfji', 'Kena is an underrated hottie Kena: Bridge Of Spirits', 't3_13hqctx', 'https://www.reddit.com/gallery/13hqctx'), ('116xkby', '2023-Feb-19 22:25', 'interestingasfuck', 't5_2qhsa', '', 't2_988vf61e', 'A family of Xolos, one of the oldest dog breeds in the world, originally from what is now Mexico.

Approximately 1 million Americans have a stent inserted each year. \\n - Stent insertion is not a major surgery.

Recently, I was lucky enough to win a legit clone of the Happy Hour Event Meowth (listed here on serbii(http://www.serebii.net/events/dex/052.shtml) eventdex) from some Pokemon Giveaway Facebook groups, that I joined.  After receiving it, I wanted to share my good fortunes with the Reddit community, and had it cloned by /u/Teem214.  Make sure you guys thank him!  If it wasn\\'t for him - I wouldn\\'t be able to host this giveaway!  With that said here are the specifics regarding the pokemon being given away today.\\n\\n\\n_____________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\n#So here is what I am giving away:  \\n\\n\\n|Qty|Pokeball|Pokemon|Nature|Ability|Egg Moves|OT/TID|\\n|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|\\n|10|Cherish Ball(#ps-cherish)|Meowth|Lonely|Pickup|Happy Hour, Screech, Bite, Fake Out|Happy/08196|\\n\\n\\n_____________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\nSince these are **LEGIT CLONES** they all still have the \"classic ribbon\" from the event.  Which means they must be traded via FC - and cannot go through GTS, which is why I only have 10 to give away.  In order to win a clone - you will need to follow the rules listed below.  Once again, if you break any of these rules **YOU WILL BE BANNED FROM THIS GIVEAWAY!**  This is your warning - you will not be warned again in the comments - you will just get a comment saying you have been banned.  So please read the rules carefully - and follow ALL OF THEM!\\n\\n\\n_____________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\n##RULES\\n* NO RESERVATIONS ALLOWED\\n* DO NOT PM ME ABOUT A POKEMON\\n* You are limited to **ONE ENTRY PER PERSON!**  Regardless if you have different games/IGNs/accounts - one entry per person!\\n* In order to be eligible to win a set of Kanto starters - you must comment below with the following:\\n\\n\\n1. In **one comment** tell me your favorite pokemon from Team Rocket (Meowth, Arbok, Koffing, Wobuffet, Gourgeist, Inkay, etc) as well as the phrase \"#HAPPYHOUR\" - **an example comment is \"Meowth #HAPPYHOUR\".**\\n2. Make sure you only enter 1 comment - DO NOT REPLY TO YOUR COMMENT IF YOU MISSED SOMETHING **OR YOU WILL BE BANNED**.\\n3. Once you make a valid entry - I will reply to your comment with a number - that will be your entry number for the giveaway.\\n4. After all 100 valid entries have been made - I will close the giveaway and run a random number generator (RNG) to choose 10 winners.\\n5. Once the winners have been announced - I will tag your reddit username - and you will have 24 hours to claim your prizes before they go to the next person.\\n\\n\\n______________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\n###Additional Guidelines\\n* If you already have this event pokemon - I will ask that you please refrain from entering this giveaway.  This giveaway was meant to give back to the people that could not obtain this event pokemon on their own - and really need it.\\n* DO NOT EDIT OR DELETE YOUR COMMENTS!  If you forgot a rule - then you forgot a rule - don\\'t try to fix your mistake and take the prize away from someone else who can follow the rules.  I will be watching the comments as they come into my inbox - and if see that you edited/deleted your comment and/or made multiple comments **YOU WILL BE BANNED FROM THIS GIVEAWAY!**\\n* Please be aware that with the way formatting works on this sub - hashtag/pound sign may not show up in your comment - which is fine - I will be able to see the formatting of it.\\n* Don\\'t forget to set up your flair before your comment - or your comment will get deleted by the moderators.  Use the sidebar and follow the instructions for set up BEFORE commenting.\\n* Lastly, have fun - and if you have any additional questions/concerns before commenting - feel free to leave a separate comment that starts with \"QUESTION:\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThanks everyone - again I hope you all enjoy this giveaway - and don\\'t forget to thank /u/Teem214 for cloning these guys for me!

We were sitting at the bar, and a woman asked if the seat next to us was taken. We said no, she sat, ordered a bud light, and started scrolling on her phone. Totally normal, nothing to see here.\\n\\nAfter a while, she called over the bartender, and asked him to take a picture with her, as she was on a scavenger hunt and innneed of a photo with a person who had dreadlocks. She stood at the end of the bar, phone in hand, staring at him. She was standing in a way that prevented him from stepping out from behind the bar, clearly expecting him to drop everything for this once in a lifetime photo op. But he politely declined.\\n\\nKaren told him that she didn't need his face, just his hair, and that it shouldn't be an issue. She immediately started getting agitated that he wasn't moving fast enough.\\n\\nThe bartender instead came to the opposite end of the bar and started chatting with the people sitting over on our side. Explained what was happening, and we kept him busy with drink orders hoping she'd get the hint.\\n\\nShe eventually got bored and sat back down. Drama averted right?\\n\\nNope.\\n\\nThe following escalating exchange occurred over a span of less than 5 minutes.\\n\\nEK: hey dreadlocks, are you gonna take that picture now, let's go.\\n\\nBT: My name is Mike (not really), and I've already told you I don't want to take a picture with you.\\n\\nEK: Why is this such an issue for you, I don't even want your face, you can turn around, I just want your hair.\\n\\nBT: No, I'm not interested, please stop asking.\\n\\nEK: Mike, Mike, MIIIIIKE, just one, why are you being difficult? I said I'd pay you, what's the issue. You'll get a tip, OMG!\\n\\n(At this point, BT handed her the tab for her (still untouched) beer, and she paid.)\\n\\nEK: There! (Slams pen on the bar and practically throws the little tray with the bill across the counter.) I gave you a 50 dollar tip, now take the picture, I paid for it!\\n\\n(BT heads for the back to get a manager.)\\n\\nVarious Other customers: he said he doesn't want to, leave him alone.\\n\\n(EK suddenly materialized behind us, puts one arm around my husband's shoulders, and one arm around me.)\\n\\nEK: You guys are nerds, you know what you need? Go get some girlfriends, stop being nerds. I've been with women, you two need to get out more, start dating! Don't be nerds!\\n\\nME: please don't touch me.\\n\\nEK: You are such a nerd, omg there's nothing wrong with touching you!\\n\\nME: I said don't touch me (I pulled away and released myself from her vice-like Karen grip.) Just stop, you are making a fool of yourself, your behavior towards BT is racist and uncalled for. Just go home!\\n\\nEK: Oh MY behavior is uncalled for huh? Yeah that's right! Fuck all of you, I'm going home. MIKE, SERIOUSLY, I PAID YOU ANYWAY, YOU DIDNT EVEN HAVE TO DO ANYTHING!\\n\\nAt this point, Karen picked up her receipt and the tray, slammed it down onto the bar a few more times as if she was trying to slide it towards BT, and thankfully leaves.\\n\\nBT and a manager returned, BT showed the manager the tab, told him what happened, and the rest of our evening was uneventful.\\n\\nSomeone please explain what the fuck happened here, because I don't get it.\", 't2_3mo6pkjq', 'Karen vs Everyone', 't3_tonj6l', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledBitch/comments/tonj6l/karen_vs_everyone/'), ('8vv22n', '2018-Jul-03 14:25', 'PUNCHPLANET', 't5_3g9nd', '', 't2_1iwohr', 'Come Playtest Maxx during #redbullconquest Mashfest NYC happyhour Tonight @6pm', 't3_8vv22n', 'https://twitter.com/PunchPlanet/status/1014226441154768898'), ('39ljhm', '2015-Jun-12 11:05', 'MakeupAddiction', 't5_2rww2', \"OBLIGATORY STILA LINK(http://www.stilacosmetics.com)\\n\\nI'm **really** contemplating getting some Liquid Lipsticks...but IDK!

I know vaping isn’t “healthy” but I’ll be damned if I don’t quit on my own terms and I’m not the type of person who likes these decisions being made on my behalf. As the result of moral panic over a phenomenon that parents don't understand but find very frightening, all of us adult vapers are now tarred with the same brush as the 14 yr old puffing a juul in the school toilet. I find this very disturbing, and due to my anxious disposition and sudden fear of drastic change to my lifestyle I too went into a panic - that was until I had formulated my survival guide for the vapeocalypse. \\n\\nThere have been lots of posts about what exactly this new ban entails, when it comes into effect, and how widespread the crackdown will be especially in terms of mod vapes/ the non-disposable side of things. As per the title of this post and for the purposes of this exercise I will assume the vapeocalypse is upon us and that we can anticipate the worst possible scenario which includes:  \\n\\n* Complete removal of disposable vapes + a system like dob-in-a-dealer where parent activists report Ez Marts etc to authorities. \\n\\n* Total destruction of Aussie vape industry - replacement coils for regulated tanks (Vaporesso, geekvape, etc), flavoured juice, pods, mods, tanks, and other hardware becomes inaccessible and illegal. \\n\\n* End of the PIS import scheme for getting nic from NZ even with a doctors script. \\n\\n* Pharmaceutical domination of vaping with crappy pod systems as the new de facto vape.\\n\\n* All the above will be implemented completely by August 1st 2023 (take this with a grain of salt).  \\n\\nSo, with that out of the way please enjoy the fruits of my addiction driven psychological spiral and subsequent coping. \\n\\n* Nicotine \\n\\nNicotine is the only ingredient that I anticipate will become extremely difficult/ borderline risky to acquire in the future under this proposed ban. Due to the concentration and strength required for good home-mixed juices I recommend getting a script and importing as much as you can in the interim. I went on QuitRX, paid the $70, and had my script within 5hrs of submitting their questionnaire. You do not NEED a script in the practical sense, however it's a good safety net in case your order gets stopped by customs. I did a bit of a sneaky one and placed two orders from two different vendors (VaporEyes NZ, Mixology Vape NZ), one at my max allowable amount of Nic and another that was about double that (pushing the envelope but fuck it). Once these have both been received I’ll probably consider ordering more and maxing out my script again in a similar fashion. I currently mix nic at quite low concentrations already and anticipate with this cache of Nic I can continue vaping and tapering down for years to come. \\n\\n* E-Juice. \\n\\nWe’re going to need to mix our own e-juice. I for one care not for tobacco or pure menthol flavours and do not intend to give up my watermelon or green apple clouds. The raw ingredients for juice are readily available due to use in the food and cosmetics industries. You can get propylene glycol (PG) and vegetable glycol (VG) for ~$15-$30 a litre online. Look for pharmacy grade or kosher grade products. Flavour concentrates are more or less the same for vaping as in other food products (boiled lollies, beers, cake batter, soda post-mix) and pretty cheap so get a selection of these and start experimenting. I will also be stocking up on 0% nic flavoured juices while they’re available but only as a stop-gap measure while I get gud at mixing my own juice. \\n\\n* Hardware. \\n\\nAs I mentioned, I currently use replaceable coils for my tank. Importing coils may remain possible however in this scenario I assume coils and other consumable are unavailable. Your best bet will be getting a few rebuildable tanks, replacement glass if required, and some durable mods. I’ve opted for the Geekvape zeus RTA tank plus the RDA version as well (The RDA tank has no breakable glass components). I’ll probably get a few more bits and bobs but this is the starting point for my journey with rebuildables.I’ve also picked up a durable Geekvape Aegis regulated mod which I’ll keep at home and use as my daily driver. I think I will likely get a mechanical mod as well as there are no internal electronics and they are apparently quite durable and repairable although require advanced vape knowhow. \\n\\nAs for making coils, stock up on cotton and wire. You’ll need to do your own research however I believe the materials will remain available to us although not via vape shops. You can get medical grade pure cotton suitable for wicks pretty cheaply. Stock up now on wire for coils as well and look for an electronics store/industrial supplier that sells kanthal/Nichrome wire in your favourite gauge. Similarly to juices, I’m stocking up on some disposable coils to use while I get my chops up at winding my own. \\n\\n* Rollback of the ban or revisions of a failed policy. \\n\\nAlthough I classify myself firmly in the category of pessimist, I also think that there is a chance these measures will come under fire at some point, especially if the black market reaction is stronger than those in the Govt are anticipating. My entire approach here isn’t so much about extending my vape-timeline into eternity, but having a comfortable cache to ride out 3-5yrs of nonsense while waiting for the other shoe to drop and more rational policies brought to the table. \\n\\n* Parting thoughts and hot tips. \\n\\nWe have time to prepare and voice our dissatisfaction, so take advantage of it and contact Mark Butler’s office and your local federal member. Make friends with our neighbours in New Zealand as they may be a shining sliver of hope for getting hardware, nic, and other supplies in the not so distant future. \\n\\nTldr: Time to go old school and get into DIY rebuildables and juice.

Credit card company is telling me to pound sand. What are my options?**\\n\\nA few weeks ago I went to a bar in NYC while on a trip. My bill came out to around 60 dollars. I left a 20 dollar tip that would have brought the total to around 84 dollars. A few days later I see a charge for 184 on my credit card. The bar does not have a phone number. The only way to contact them is through sending them a message on their website. I did and received no response. I attempted calling the hotel next door but they refused to get my in touch with the bar. It's too far for me to go in person. I filed a dispute with my credit card company who has now told me to pound sand because I dont have a receipt. Even though my copy of the receipt would only have the original bill amount of around 60 dollars anyway. Doesnt matter. They need a receipt. Also the bar legally has to hold on to receipts for several years for this reason. Doesnt matter, credit card company wont budge. What are my options?  \\n\\nEdit. Am I allowed to name and shame the bar and cc company here?  \\n\\n2nd edit. Wow this got alot of attention. For now I'm going to file a police report and call my CC company again. I will demand a manager and have the CFPB website open on a laptop and tell them if they dont help me I will file a complaint while in the phone with them and be sure to include the managers name in it. If that doesnt get me anywhere I will get the NYC liquor board involved. Thanks everyone for the advice. I will do another update once the dust has settled. Also I will be switching to another credit card.  \\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nUpdated post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/sr3dxq/update_a_bartender_wrote_themselves_a_100_extra/), restored(https://www.reddit.com/r/bestoflegaladvice/comments/sr88ki/an_update_to_laop_doesnt_appreciate_the_pro_tip/) on r/bestoflegaladvice on Feb 12/13, 2022:\\n\\nThis is what occurred over the next several days. I called the credit card company again who insisted I needed a receipt. Eventually I escalated it to a manager who said they could claim it as fraud. That would involve my current card being canceled and a new one sent to me. They money was returned to my account. The next day I got an e-mail stating the claim was denied, and the money was taken from my account again. I once again called the cc company, and was told I needed a receipt again and that the person who ran the fraud claim shouldn't have because it wasn't technically fraud. I escalated to a manager again. They eventually agreed to just give me a credit of 100 dollars to my account courtesy of the company. Likely just so I would stop yelling at them. It has been a week and the case is considered closed. The bar/ bartender got to keep the money they took, but I also was refunded by the CC company. I asked the manager about this policy of needing the receipt and they refused to budge or say otherwise. Every single person I talked to (about 10) all said that a receipt is needed for ANY dispute. They do not protect their customers. I put a streaming service subscription on the card to keep it active. But will never use it again. I have switched to a different cc company for my daily use card.

A few weeks ago, a woman came into our bar. She looked probably about 7/8 months. For context, I’m one of the head bartenders. I was minding my own business training a new hire around 4 or 5pm. One of the other bartenders, Annie (19 F) came up to me to talk about a ridiculous customer she had. \\n\\nThat customer being the pregnant woman. She wanted a glass of red wine, and Annie refused to serve her and suggested we asked her to leave. I looked at her like she had two heads. Even if someone LOOKS pregnant, you still have to serve them or that can be a discrimination lawsuit waiting to happen. As much as I DIDNT like it, I got her the glass of wine and minded my two cents. I went back to training our new hire when Annie saw the woman with glass of wine, she asked if we could talk in the back and of course I obliged. She went on a rant how I was a “baby killer”, I was a terrible person, etc. At this point the other staff members saw this going on, and most minded their business, and a few of the girls told her to cut it out. \\n\\nI told her whether we like it or not, someone needed to serve the woman. I sure as hell wasn’t putting my ass on the line for a lawsuit over a glass of wine. Plus, i didn’t know the woman’s medical history, and it sure as hell wasn’t any of my business. I left it at that. Over the next two weeks Annie went on a tirade about how I was a terrible person, was going to hell, was a baby killer, etc. Eventually I got fed up and reported her to the GM.

Realizing I don\\'t have any cash, I\\'m like \"dude do you have venmo or something?\" (I know, lol) and he\\'s like \"ahh don\\'t even worry about it man it\\'s no big deal\" but I\\'m a service industry vet so I wanted to find a way to tip him because I know it\\'s gonna be a long night and a lot of people won\\'t tip.\\n\\nSo I\\'m like \"alright man well, if my wife has some cash I\\'ll double back over...but uh, in the meantime...if you party...\" and I show him the pen. \\n\\nHe\\'s like \"oh for real? hell ya dude.\" And proceeds to take an *enormous* puff on this thing. \\n\\nWithin seconds he was doubling over and coughing uncontrollably, it was incredibly loud and in under a minute he was down on his hands and knees behind the bar puking in the grass. Still...kind of no harm no foul...until he gets up and puts all of his weight onto a tumbler glass that was sitting on the table he used to help himself up. Cutting his hand open...so...so badly. \\n\\nAnd then something very interesting happened. Something that had never happened before. I started vomiting at the sight of the blood. \\n\\nSo naturally this is pretty disruptive, and the groom who just so happened to be nearby, comes over to see what\\'s going on *and fucking faints* the second he sees this guy\\'s hand. Smashing his head on the bar/table on the way down, his face taking the table cloth and everything on the table down with him.\\n\\nTotally unmitigated disaster. Both of them had to go to the hospital and the bride was understandably super upset and screaming at the caterers, so I decided \"well, it\\'s been a good life\" and began to march over to explain to her what happened when out of her mouth comes a series of very specific slurs directed at the owner of the catering company. I didn\\'t get a single word out of my mouth before she said \"fucking sue me\" turned on her heel and told her people to just round their shit up and go. \\n\\nCue major shitstorm. Everyone is fighting with everyone, and almost all of the guests left. I told my wife what happened on the drive home and she said I should call the catering company and apologize, which I did, and the owner laughed for about 30 seconds on the phone before saying \"well, whatever, fuck that bitch.\" \\n\\nSo...ya. \\n\\nTLDR: Don\\'t smoke a lot of weed, got the bartender way too high causing a chain reaction of vomiting and fainting that led to a racist outburst ending a wedding.\\n\\nedit - I actually think it was a wine glass', 't2_b9zzrxo7', 'TIFU by drugging the bartender and ruining a wedding', 't3_pnr4mt', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/pnr4mt/tifu_by_drugging_the_bartender_and_ruining_a/'), ('tcunfv', '2022-Mar-12 18:18', 'interestingasfuck', 't5_2qhsa', '', 't2_a1vehfd7', 'The FIRE BREATHING BARTENDER !!!', 't3_tcunfv', 'https://v.redd.it/17g848drn1n81'), ('12di21c', '2023-Apr-06 07:01', 'aww', 't5_2qh1o', '', 't2_peage6gr', 'bartender cat!', 't3_12di21c', 'https://i.redd.it/iwk4p15bpasa1.gif'), ('ioapyi', '2020-Sep-07 11:31', 'ChoosingBeggars', 't5_35fmc', '', 't2_c5myw2v', 'Choosing beggars.

I just turned 21 about a month ago, and I went to a dive bar/music venue to drink and watch a show. I look incredibly young in person, but my ID is up-to-date and so is my passport as well.

So I tell the bartender I have a passport and he is confiscating my real ID and he says he will believe me when I bring my passport.\\n\\nI retrieve my passport, which clearly shows my age, and this time I ask to speak to the manager. The manager REFUSES to give my ID back, saying he\\'s going to call the police to confiscate it, AND THEN HE TAKES MY PASSPORT. No, I\\'m not kidding, I wish I was. He went on a rant about how I tried so hard to act \"of age\" and had all this fake proof and a fake life. By this point the venue is almost empty and the bouncers kick us out.

I\\'m going to support her and try to figure out the full story.\\n\\nI\\'ve read every comment in here. I was responding to many with information in these updates, but there are far too many to reply to. Most of the top comments were posted early and are quick to tell me to break up. If you read the rest, they are probably split 60/40 about whether she set it all up or if she was assaulted.\\n\\nTo everyone saying that she should break up with me for how I have handled this so far. Please try to understand how emotional this ordeal has been for both of us. She came to me saying she made a mistake and that it was her fault. And she hid it for over a month. I only learned all of this *yesterday* and I freaked out.\\n\\n\\\\---\\n\\nOriginal post:\\n\\nThis has turned into a wall of text so I thank anyone who reads. It\\'s probably too much detail, but it\\'s been therapeutic to write it all out.\\n\\n**Background**\\n\\nI (24/m) have been going out with my girlfriend (22/f) for just over 3 years. We do not live together. We were both living at our parents\\' houses while attending university but I recently graduated and now have my own place with a roommate. She still lives with her mom, but we have had a few discussions about moving in together.\\n\\nI work full-time at an office job and she is in class with a part-time restaurant job on the side. She started this job at the beginning of November and was hired by one of her friends. She told me it was annoying that several of the male staff members constantly flirted with her and made inappropriate jokes despite her being in a relationship. This includes the restaurant\\'s bartender (31/m).\\n\\nIn late November (only a couple weeks after she started), the staff had their annual Christmas party at the restaurant. It was on a Monday night since the restaurant is closed Tuesday mornings.\\n\\nLater that week, my girlfriend was also supposed to be housesitting/dogsitting for a friend. She had to go feed the dog every day and was allowed to stay overnight if she wanted (starting Tuesday). We were talking about how we both thought it was hot to have sex in someone else\\'s house, and planned to have a few wild nights when we got the chance.\\n\\n**My side of the story**\\n\\nI stayed home the night of the party. I was told it was staff only (no significant others) and I had work in the morning, so I  had no problem staying in. I dropped my girlfriend off and I was texting her throughout the night. At around 11 I told her I was going to sleep and said goodnight. I was still up another hour or so, but based on her texts she was quite drunk and it was frustrating having a regular conversation, so I didn\\'t want to text any more.\\n\\nI sent her a message the next morning and didn\\'t hear back until around 2pm, when she informed me she was extremely hungover and slept half the day. Even though her mom\\'s house was just around the corner from the restaurant, she said she instead decided to go to the dogsitting house (a day early) since it was on the way to the bar that some people headed to after the party. Apparently the homeowners left earlier Monday night.\\n\\nWe hung out later that night and she showed me photos of the party. I saw most people brought their significant others, and I was kind of insulted. I confronted her about it and she said she didn\\'t think we were supposed to be invited and that I shouldn\\'t have cared since I had work the next day anyways. We had a minor disagreement but nothing serious.\\n\\nThe next couples days were normal, we were happy, and Thursday night I suggested we go over the dogsitting house together. She started acting weird and said she didn\\'t want to do that any more, but we could hang out at my place. We did, watched some tv, and I tried to initiate sex. She refused and said I was being too pushy and went home. I didn\\'t think I did anything wrong and I was frustrated.\\n\\nThe next two weeks or so were more of the same. No sex, which led to frustration and silly arguments over little things. She started exams in mid/late December and stress was through the roof. Finally, after she finished exams we went out to a party, went home together and had sex. It had been probably 3 weeks, and previously we were having sex \\\\~5 times a week.\\n\\nOver the Christmas break we resumed having lots of sex, but things still didn\\'t feel right. There were lots of arguments. We both returned to work/school and it seemed like every day there was some new disagreement. And now today... we were fighting about something stupid (whether or not her friend calling me \"Garfield\" should be insulting), and trying to resolve it. I made an offhand comment about how these little fights shouldn\\'t bother me so much, it\\'s not like she cheated on me.\\n\\nAnd then she broke down. She started sobbing and saying that she made a huge mistake at the Christmas party. She said she couldn\\'t bear to tell me and wanted to kill herself.\\n\\n**Her side of the story**\\n\\nAfter the crying stopped, I made her tell me what happened. I was pretty pissed off and yelling because she basically told me she cheated on me a MONTH AND A HALF ago and tried to hide it. This is her side. A lot of it is pieced together from her messages and what her coworkers told her, since she has no little memory of the night.\\n\\nThe party was open-bar, and she and her friend were hanging out at at bar most of the night. The bartender was another employee who had volunteered to take the night off from drinking to serve everyone else. Partway through the night, he started giving her drinks that she wasn\\'t even asking for. She was having a good time and accepted them. Eventually she got blackout drunk, still pretty early in the night too. She doesn\\'t remember me texting her goodnight, which was only around 11pm.\\n\\nAt midnight, she texted the dogsitting people asking if she could go over that night. There was no answer of course, since they were on an international flight somewhere. Everyone kept drinking until about 12:30 am. Around 1 am, the bartender drove a group of people from the party to a bar. He returned to the party to drive the last carload of people to the bar. Everyone else had made their way home by this point.\\n\\nHe dropped everyone at the bar except my girlfriend. He told the others he would drive her home, but together they then went back to the dogsitting house. I don\\'t know the exact details of what happened next. But around 3 am, she sent a photo to their work group chat. It includes her, the bartender, and the dog in a bed. You could only see from their shoulders up but they were obviously shirtless. She included a message that said \"I hope everyone is having a good time! I know we are!\"\\n\\nShe insists she has zero recollection of this happening. She woke up Tuesday lunchtime and was surprised she wasn\\'t in her own bed. The bartender wasn\\'t there when she got up and there was no sign of him. She said she assumed she must have decided to go out to the bar after, which is why she asked to stay at the dogsitting house instead of her own.\\n\\nApparently she didn\\'t find out what happened until Thursday when she was talking to her friend. She was shown the picture she sent, which was since buried in the group chat. She still insists she has no memory of anything, and freaked out and didn\\'t know what to do. That\\'s why she refused to go to that house with me and why things suddenly got so weird between us. She says she wanted to deny to herself that it happened and didn\\'t want to tell me.\\n\\nAfter finding out the truth today, there has been lots of yelling and crying, and I\\'m currently home by myself.\\n\\n**My thoughts**\\n\\nFirst of all, I do believe she was taken advantage of. She was blackout drunk and the bartender was sober (and significantly older). Her coworkers all confirmed that the bartender told everyone he was dropping her at home, and also that he was feeding her free drinks all night. I also believe she didn\\'t remember it happening at first, because there was a definite mood change on Thursday, which lines up with when she said she found out.\\n\\nHowever, I can\\'t help but feel like she was willing even if she was drunk. I\\'m hurt and it feels like I was cheated on. It\\'s not like the bartender took her home against her will and assaulted her. She figured out the logistics of finding a place to go with him and looked extremely happy in the photo.\\n\\nWhy it still feels like cheating:\\n\\n* I was told I wasn\\'t invited to the party when everyone else brought their SOs.\\n* She had access to the dogsitting house a day earlier than I thought.\\n* She had brought the key to dogsitting house to her work party, even though it was right next to her mom\\'s house.\\n* The bartender is a guy who had openly flirted with her for weeks.\\n* She didn\\'t tell me what happened for over a month, and had planned on hiding it forever.\\n\\nIn anger I told her that if this wasn\\'t cheating then she must have been sexually assaulted. And that if we don\\'t press charges then at the very least we need to ensure the bartender loses his job. She cried again and refused to do either. Since she can\\'t remember the night, she isn\\'t willing to report him for anything and can\\'t confirm she didn\\'t want it.\\n\\nWhat do you guys think? I\\'m an emotional mess right now and struggling to be logical. Do I need to put emotion behind me and support her as a victim? Or is she a cheater? Things were great before this and I had hoped to spend my life with this girl.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**UPDATE 1:**\\n\\nI spoke to her again today and said that there were too many coincidences that make this seem like she planned it out. I told her I needed a bit of time to figure this out but I didn\\'t think I would be able to move past it. I know drawing this out is probably not the best way to handle anything but all logic goes out the window when you\\'re the one involved in a mess like this. However, there are still a few updates worth mentioning.\\n\\n* We looked at the photo again, and it really looks like **the bartender took the photo!**\\n* There were only 2 coherent messages she sent after I said goodnight: 1 to the homeowners and 1 along with the photo in the groupchat. She had a few other messages to a non-work friend during this time that are complete nonsense.\\n* She showed me an earlier message where her friend said the party was staff only.\\n* She insisted she had never messaged the bartender except within the work group chat. She showed me unaccepted facebook and snapchat invites from him, and said she didn\\'t even have his number. She was willing to let me use a recovery tool to prove they had never messaged but I didn\\'t go through with it.\\n* She had the key on her keychain since she picked it up from the homeowners (like a week in advance). She is so adamant about this that she was checking photos she took of her odometer hitting 100k to see if her keys were visible, but no proof.\\n* She said she would be willing to report the bartender to work for sexual harassment, but was still uneasy about pressing charges.\\n* She still went through with it and hid it from me, so even if her story is completely true somehow, I\\'m not sure if I can move past it.\\n\\n\\\\---\\n\\n**Update 2 is at the top.**', 't2_hvsuw', \"Girlfriend (22/f) slept with the bartender (31/m) at work party back in November.

It's a beer and shot bar with regulars type of place. I'm friend's with the owners. We've had our ups and downs that escaladed but we've always worked through it. I have 1 shift every other Saturday. Tonight was slow for a Saturday so when my barback asked if he could sleep in later I told him no big deal he could take the night if he wanted to. Fast forward an hour, the bar had about 20 people and nothing insane. Once I covered my customers I went out for a cigarette. Of course some kid walks in right as I light the damn thing and so I figure he can wait 4 drags. In that time the owner sees a customer not being helped, loses her shit about where's the fucking bartender. I come in as she handed the kid his drink and she goes off on me that this place better be spotless when I close. She expects I sweep, mop, vacuum (yes, this bar is carpeted) and everything to be perfect because I cut my barback (again, no I didn't). She proceeds to pull another employee into the office to bitch about me while the other owner screamed at me behind the bar, physically blocking me in so I cannot get out and screaming at me to just do my fucking job. I took a deep breath. Spoke with some regulars who witnessed all of it and they encouraged me to leave. The problem is this bar has been my home bar forever. It's more than just leaving a job. So I continued to serve customers and do some dishes. Stocked the bar mostly, grabbed my tips. When boss no1 sat down and gave me the most childish gaslighting apology and I explained that it wasn't her comment that has set be off, it was partner #2. After telling her what he said she called me a liar and he chimed in also screaming at me (still on the floor mind you) that I'm lying. I said fine. I grabbed my things, said thank you for my employment and I left. I'm upset I lost my shit, I pride myself on my composure. I'm upset one of my favorite jobs I've ever had ended like this. But for the first time I respect myself too much to be spoken to like that.\\n\\n**Edit: about cutting the barback: after I told him he could take the night off he told me he'd come in later but just wanted to take a nap.

Basically I picked up shifts whenever I was back from uni, paid per shift. They had a decent turnover of back of house staff, so as someone who knew pretty much everything in there I would generally be the person to fix issues whenever a newer member of staff had a problem.\\n\\n\\nSo I\\'m on a barbecue shift, which means I\\'m running food outside. There\\'s also a bar out there  which was taken care of by a female coworker (FC), and every now and then a manager would check up and make sure everything was alright. We had 3 managers on at the time, and they generally helped out wherever was needed - nobody was afraid to get their hands dirty. It was a quiet night, so we were basically chilling out there, serving the occasional burger or drink.\\n \\n\\nWell I go in to help out on glasses since as always it was backed up, and when I came back out again this guy was basically standing angrily by the bar. FC is visibly upset, not crying or anything but clearly not having a good time, and as I walk up this guy sees my apron and puts his hands on his hips. \\n\\n\\n\"Finally! Get me your manager, I want this girl gone!\" He says (or words to that extent).\\n\\n\\nNow I\\'m understandably doubtful she\\'s done anything that bad, especially since she\\'s relativdly new, so before doing anything I bring FC round the back and ask her. Turns out she\\'d messed up this guy\\'s pint, and he\\'d gone off about how women can\\'t pour beer and that she shouldn\\'t even be there, it was a man\\'s job, etcetera. I told her I\\'d sort it out, leave him with me and you continue to watch the bar in the meanwhile. \\n\\n\\nNow i wasnt going to let this go unpunished, so here\\'s where the compliance comes in.\\n\\n\\nRemember there are 3 managers on at the time. 2 were on the floor currently, both men and both perfectly capable of sorting this out, but the 3rd was female. We\\'ll call her Kate. Now Kate was the most senior manager on, hence why she was in the office sorting out admin and emails etc, and she took absolutely no shit whatsoever. For reference, when she finally left the pub it was to go work as a prison officer. She was a damn good manager for getting things done, but definitely not afraid to stamp her authority if need be. In short, not someone you want to be on the wrong end of.\\n\\n\\nYou can guess which manager I went to. \\n\\n\\nShe was at first annoyed I was trying to drag her all the way outside, but when I explained fully she just stopped typing, stood up and told me to lead the way, which I did. Smiling all the way, because I knew exactly what was coming next.\\n\\n\\nI lead her down, and as the guy sees us approaching his face just falls of a cliff. I\\'ve never seen anyone go from angry to \"oh shit\" that quickly ever since, it was just glorious. \\n\\n\\nKate is of course very polite, but makes a point of introducing herself as head manager of the pub, not strictly true but it got the job done. He stutters about having his pint messed up and she tells him he can have another one on the house. Then she proceeds to go behind the bar and pour it herself, before handing it to him.\\n\\n\\nI can feel how badly he wants to complain about it from across the bar, but eventually he takes his drink and walks off without another word. Kate just gives me a look and a little smile before walking back to the office. \\n\\n\\nYes it probably would have been more efficient to do literally anything else to resolve this whole thing, in fact I probably could have just comped a drink myself and he would have pissed off, but oh the result was worth it.\\n\\n\\n\\nEDIT: Wow, well this blew up more than I expected. O_o\\nI\\'ll try to answer a few of the questions in the comments:\\n\\n\\n\\n- How did she mess up the pint?\\n\\nI don\\'t know for certain but I\\'m like 80% sure she had too much head. The outside bar has a limited selection of beers (and cider strangely enough) on tap, but you have to roll the kegs down there yourself and get whatever manager is doing them to change them over. Depending on who rolls them they can be pretty lively, especially if the keg is full or almost empty.\\n\\n\\n\\n- Why did she give him a free beer?\\n\\nIt wasnt exactly free, since he\\'d already paid for the first one and refused it, but we still had to put a pint as wastage on the system so it worked out that way. Thing is this pub is part of a chain (Brunning and Price), so reputation is much more valuable than a single beer or whatever. Granted he was an asshole, but as much as I\\'d have loved to pour his beer on his head I\\'m pretty sure I would have been in deep shit with regional for doing so. I assume that\\'s the same reason Kate didn\\'t go off on him as well, but I don\\'t know for certain. Long story short you don\\'t shout at customers, you smile and put up with it. Sucks but that\\'s how it was.\\n\\n\\n\\n- What\\'s the deal with her being new and \"less likely to make a mistake?\"\\n\\nUsually the newer someone is, the more likely they are to make mistakes. The thing is though these are usually small problems, like following protocol and not knowing one part, and from the way he was reacting you\\'d think she\\'d actively insulted him or done something serious. Knowing how strictly new hires follow the rules I doubted she\\'d done anything that warranted that reaction, but I did ask her to make sure first. I\\'m there to solve problems after all, not to make them.\\n\\n\\n\\n- Was this guy real?\\n\\nUnfortunately yes. Truth be told he\\'s not even the worst I\\'ve had to deal with, a few people see a single bartender and no managers and like to try one on, though almost none of them are genuinely rude. The outside bar closes a little earlier than the inside one, but people really like to try getting free stuff while we\\'re closing down.

It\\'s based on my experience of living in this region for 4 years. Of course it\\'s not comprehensive, but that means anyone who wants to contribute in the future can. My list is primarily based on beers in the Spanish Basque Country, from Bizkaia, Alava, and Gipuzkoa. \\n\\n**Breweries:**\\n\\nOf course I can\\'t know them all, but I know many. \\n\\nBasqueland - is the king of basque craft beer. They release new beers often (possibly too often), and is the standard of basque craft. They experiment a lot. \\n\\nGross - Very popular brewery with a great taproom in Donosti-San Sebastian. They don\\'t experiment too much.\\n\\nLaugur - They are known for their very strong Russian Imperial Stouts. They are loved by the hop heads in Basque Country. \\n\\nMala Gissona - They have solid beers, but mostly stick to the same roster of reliable ales.\\n\\nDrunken Bros - Small brewery with not much experimentation. \\n\\nBizio - This is cider of the highest level. It\\'s organic, and bio friendly. The sediment at the bottom of every bottle is delicious. \\n\\nSaltus - For me (a west coast transplant), the best West Coast IPAs in the region. Great craftsmanship.\\n\\nMeta Edabeak - very adventurous crafter who focuses on local ingredients and flavors. \\n\\nMitika - from Navarra, but still Basque Country - great line of beer inspired by basque myths. \\n\\nNaparbier - from Navarra, with a great selection of IPAs and stouts\\n\\n**Bars** (again, I don\\'t know every spot, but I know many. If I have something to say, I write. If not, I don\\'t:\\n\\nCafe Bihotz \\\\(Bilbao\\\\)(https://goo.gl/maps/aE9cdgioFofnuKK1A) - the best craft beer selection and expertise in the Basque Country. This also happens to be a coffee lover\\'s spot too. \\n\\nSingular \\\\(Bilbao\\\\)(https://goo.gl/maps/FpbTt2W3Arkmt5pf6) - classy bar in bilbao with a great bottle selection and 8 taps that are always refreshed. \\n\\nCraft Beer Taberna \\\\(Bilbao\\\\)(https://goo.gl/maps/rqnCQCK55jdsiJyj8) - Laugur\\'s tap room, plus special guests on tap. \\n\\nMorrocutuda \\\\(Bilbao\\\\)(https://goo.gl/maps/qnbAi6RktAKqrSXN8) - romantic little bar with a decent selection and good pintxos\\n \\nTxinuk \\\\(Getxo\\\\)(https://goo.gl/maps/xdbfbMzVL11WtQjS9) - In the suburbs of Bilbao. If you\\'re in the neighborhood, stop by. \\n\\n15,000 Hops \\\\(Barakaldo\\\\)(https://goo.gl/maps/LjmovjouptcxYMpH6) - In the suburbs of Bilbao. If you\\'re in the neighborhood, stop by. Also has a great punk rock theme/scene\\n\\nTegobi \\\\(Bilbao\\\\)(https://goo.gl/maps/6V7348TcajMrDfDL6) - Small quiet bar to get away from it all\\n\\nPenguin \\\\(Bilbao\\\\)(https://goo.gl/maps/HK2aZ9JLRv6vRUtGA)\\n\\nLa Ley Seca \\\\(Bilbao\\\\)(https://goo.gl/maps/136Ykk74BYYwx4dX8) - small selection of craft beers, but it\\'s in the old town.

The pintxos will leave you with great memories. \\n\\nBasqueLand Izakaia \\\\(Donosti San Sebasian\\\\)(https://goo.gl/maps/kYze9jfVAsvjix2f7) - Basqueland\\'s taproom with their fresh offerings, and guest beers too. The food has an asian theme, and it\\'s tasty. \\n\\nMala Gissona Beer House \\\\(Donosti San Sebastian\\\\)(https://goo.gl/maps/JrQ7Kkqct19ChZ6Q6)\\n\\nEnsantxe \\\\(Donosti San Sebastian\\\\)(https://goo.gl/maps/meqkkwKnACctu8P46) \\n\\nAkerbeltz \\\\(Donosti San Sebastian\\\\)(https://goo.gl/maps/jBd4UdAnH5LRP3197)  - big selection of beers on tap, and in bottle.

I’ve watched SortaKindaBored’s layout a couple times and I’m gonna try and say it in as least words as I can…\\n\\nEmber Infierno, aka Emmuh, aka lots of other characters makes first contact with a letter with her phone number, Oreos, and other niceties. \\n\\nRamona Quimby’s (first major catfish gf)mother is watching TCAP and shows Ramona because Ramona loves true crime shit. Ramona is intrigued with Lorne and has her brother contact Emmuh for Lorne’s contact info. \\n\\nLorne is with Ramona for roughly a year. With Ramona’s saga we see the doctor, the therapist, Ramona’s bro, and Machelle Simpson who was a catfish trying to meet Lorne at Dunkin Donuts for sex. This character was to test the waters to see what they could get away with. \\n\\nCatfish after Ramona is Casey Mauro played by Tiffany Lockhart and Emmuh (yea the Casey Mauro from the sting). She’s about 30, addicted to drugs and sex, has a couple kids, lives with her evil rich father, and has had a horrible life in regard to sexual assault. Casey has a brother named ~~Will~~  Nick. Casey’s dad Paul “bought” Casey and ~~Will~~  Nick as children so he could make them actors and become rich.  In the end this wasn’t Casey Mauro at all and was actually Winifred Pollard aka Emmuh.  \\n\\n*Will is Winifred Pollard’s ex husband and the person Jamie Amy had dated and still has strong feelings for — Lorne has a love hate relationship with dude*\\n\\nWinifred Pollard aka Wendy aka Winnie is the third catfish and is played by Ember Infierno. Lorne refers to her as Winnie because his buddy Tony has a wife named Wendy and Lorne is simpleminded and will get them mixed up I guess.lol She is addicted to coke and has schizophrenia that came about when she was 22. She’s also a white supremacist and holds Hitler in high regard.  Winnie is talked to the most and she makes Lorne miserable, but he stays because he’s desperate. The Winnie saga is about a year long. Characters introduced here are Dan aka Crestfallen who is a lawyer and Emmuh’s bf. Lorne stays jealous of him and Winnie is inappropriate with him. There is also Debbie aka Tiffany Lockhart. There is Rhoda aka Emmuh and she is Winnie’s 17-18 year old daughter. There is GG aka Emmuh with a voice changer. This is Rhoda’s ex bf and father of LJ, Rhoda’s baby. There is also Victor, aka Emmuh with a voice changer. He’s got HIV and is a paraplegic. Then there is Jamie Amy aka Winelover. She’s Winnie and Debbie’s friend and is also a 23 year old porn star. \\n\\nSome main things that happen with Winnie is Lorne grooming Rhoda, his gf’s barely legal simpleminded daughter. One time Winnie gets a batch of bad cocaine and it puts her in the hospital. She, for some reason, gets ahold of a Die With Dignity pill and puts it in a brownie because she wants to die with dignity instead of rotting away with a sickness. While Winnie is in the bathroom one day Rhoda asks Lorne if she can have a bite of her moms pot brownie and he says yes. Winnie has put the death with dignity pill inside the brownie and Rhoda dies. The funeral was over the phone and it was hilarious. This situation also birthed one of my favorite quotes from anything…\\n\\n“ITS SUPPOSED TO BE DEATH WITH DIGNITY, NOT MURDER BY PEDOHILE!!!” 😂\\n\\nLorne moves on to Debbie, Winnie’s sister. Debbie gets Lorne to open up and talk to her and also gets him to read the chatlog from the sting with her and Emmuh outloud. She legitimately tries to help him for real, but Lorne is turned down by Debbie and and we learn that Lorne didn’t ever want to get better or anything, he just thought he could score with Debbie if he played the game. It’s infuriating really. Lorne never dates Debbie, but Lorne still gets jealous and rages. We hear of Angelo aka Emmuh with a voice changer and on Mother’s Day he says “bye pedo” to Lorne and Lorne rages all day and spends 10 minutes with his mom for mothers day because he was so upset at Debbie. He airs his grievances loudly and angrily to Dan and Jamie Amy. \\n\\nBetween Winnie and Jamie Amy sagas, Lorne goes to jail for parole violations. He stays for six months. \\n\\nLorne dates Jamie Amy the pornstar who has had a rough time with men and is an alcoholic pornstar/cam girl and you know with Lorne’s jealousy how well this went. In this saga there is Will aka Heelborne aka Winnie’s ex-husband (I’m so sorry if I’m wrong.. I do admit I’m not as familiar with Jamie Amy as the others) and MJ aka Maggie Joe and I’m not sure who she is voiced by. Both of these people are Jamie’s exes. There is also Chef Jeff, Rod, and Todd. Jamie gets Covid and it gets so bad she has to talk to Lorne with a British male robot because he couldn’t understand the female voice. There are for sure other folks, but I cannot recall them right now. \\n\\nJamie, Casey Mauro (ageen), and Lorne also start a thrupple that lasts for a short minute. \\n\\nThe thrupple eventually falls apart and Casey tells Lorne that she was being blackmailed to catfish Lorne. \\n\\nNow here we are at the Cas3y calls. \\n\\nDipshit has learned nothing and second guesses everyone who comes into his life, but he can’t help himself. No matter how rude and hateful these people act he keeps running back to them simply because they’re the only friends he has. His main irl friend Tony has died. \\n\\nApologies if I’m wrong anywhere and/or missed big pieces of info… feel free to correct me. It’s a lot of info but I tried to put it into a short summary.

Today Italy and the Tuscany region. Villa Pillo is quite an adult winery with bold ideas! 🍇\\n\\nVilla Pillo is a traditional Tuscan agriculture. It was founded already in the Middle Ages, this is what the records in the books stored in the archive of the economy tell about. It is located near the historic town of San Gimignano, which is located in the heart of the Tuscan viticultural area – Chianti. The estate is spread out on the charming hills around Gambassi Terme and includes about 500 hectares. In addition to vineyards, which occupy about half of the total area, the farm owns about 50 hectares of olive groves and the same amount of area is given for sowing. The Supertoscan blend of the Borgoforte farm was included by Wine Spectator in the top 100 wines of the year 2016.\\n\\nToday we are talking about the blend that is in this bottle - Cabernet Franc and Merlot. The Tuscan variation on the French blend was a success. Less acidic and smoother than at home. Fruity, with tones of blackberries, prunes, ripe cherries, black currants and hints of vanilla, the aroma in combination with rich, velvety, with tones of dark berries, black currants, prunes and spices will not leave indifferent even the skeptical! The completion in the form of a fruity-spicy aftertaste with nuances of vanilla will also appeal...\\n\\nPerfectly combined with meat paste, red meat, medium-aged cheeses, dried delicacies. 🤔 🍴Alas, its storage potential is not great: only 1-2 years.\\n\\n\\\\#youngsommelier #wine #winelover #winetasting #winetime #wineoclock #winetrip #winestyle #italy #wine #winemaking #tasting #sommelier #sommelierrecommends #vineyards #wein  \\n\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/roo06t9i8hoa1.png?width=1620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c106ea57f452509cf8eb43be4e254f9c035fda1\", 't2_bey5gk5i', 'Villa Pillo &gt;&gt; Chingalino', 't3_11ukqcs', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/wineline/comments/11ukqcs/villa_pillo_chingalino/'), ('15lrs7i', '2023-Aug-08 14:28', 'budapest', 't5_2rxz1', 'I am looking for a place or organization that does wine tasting in Budapest.

Along Portugal’s Douro River, wine has been grown for centuries. Even the Romans realized the area’s ideal dry-hot climate condition and planted vines in the region. Alto Douro is the first ever protected wine-growing region with its borders officially defined in 1756, and it became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2001. The region is home to the famous Port wine, and it’s also well known for its dry reds. But it’s the focus on history and tradition that makes Douro so magical. In fact, when visiting, you might see grapes being picked by hand since the hills are too steep for machines, or you may even be able to take part in crushing the grapes by foot, just as it has always been done.\\n\\nTake a sip of wine and start dreaming of Douro.

I've gone through the guides in the side-bar but it feels a bit... lacking in personal touch. So I would welcome your suggestions for the following! I would like to:\\n\\n- Eat amazing fried chicken. No matter where, fine dining or some cart in the street, I do not care. \\n- Eat amazing shaved fried catfish.\\n- Discover creole cuisine, the real deal and maybe a nice modern take on it, or an interesting fusion creole restaurant.\\n- Drink fabulous whiskey, bourbon, rye. I know Louisiana has a few distilleries and I wanna sample some fine liquor. \\n- Find THE winebar of the city. I'm a winemaker and winelover, and I'd like to treat my friends. Somewhere the wine list is never-ending, and where you can find nice little gems. \\n- Go to a classy, upscale jazz club. Not 'wear your sunday best'-classy but something nice.\\n- Go to a more 'anything goes' kinda of place for a wild night of music, no matter the genre. If possible in a safe neighborhood. We're a bit scared of the gun violence in the US, regrettably.\\n- See the least touristy, hidden sights of the city. Like that little hole in the wall every resident should know, or this nice little spot where jazz history was made, you get the point. \\n- Have a bayou experience, maybe an airboat? \\n\\nI think that's about it, off the top of my head, but feel free to advise me further, as I am sure this list must seem like the quintessential tourist's to-do list!

This is diverged from nature, where a divine being is supposed to be completely present in the actual world and consequently open to animals differently. In strict experience greatness is a condition of being that has conquered the impediments of actual presence and by certain definitions has likewise gotten autonomous of it. This is regularly showed in petition, séance, contemplation, hallucinogens' and paranormal “dreams”.\\n\\nIt is attested in different strict customs’ idea of the perfect, which diverges from the thought of a divine being (or, the Supreme) that exists solely in the actual request (immanentism), or unclear from it (polytheism). Amazing quality can be ascribed to the awesome in its being, yet in addition in its information. Hence, God may rise above both the universe and information (is outside the ability to understand of the human psyche).\\n\\nIn way of thinking, amazing quality is the fundamental ground idea from the word’s strict importance (from Latin), of climbing or going past, yet with fluctuating undertones in its diverse chronicled and social stages. It incorporates methods of reasoning, frameworks, and approaches that portray the principal structures of being, not as a philosophy (hypothesis of being), but rather as the system of rise and approval of information on being. “Supernatural” is a word gotten from the academic, assigning the extra-unmitigated ascribes of creatures.\\n\\nA transcendental wish is what rises above our own cognizance: that which is objective as opposed to just a wonder of awareness, Subsequently making everything conceivable.\\n\\nIn the otherworldly world, “supernatural” has limitless force and more hugeness than “most noteworthy”. “Highest” is utilized huge number of times by customary individuals in varying backgrounds, though “supernatural” has been utilized in a more confined way.

This is reversed as the earth continues on its orbit until the axis becomes tilted away from the sun.\\n\\nDuring the solstice, the earth’s axis is tilted at its furthest point from the sun.

The first mention of this grape dates from the third century.  \\n🍇The vineyard where the vines grow is located in one of the most popular wine-growing regions in Georgia - Kakheti.  \\nThe method of making wine in special clay amphora called Kvevri is also considered unique and ancient.  \\nThe vinification and aging of the drink in original containers, which are placed underground, preserves its phenolicity in the wine, removes excess acid and gives an unforgettable taste and aroma.  \\n👉This refined drink was created by the small Chotiashvili winery, which despite its relatively young age is known not only in Georgia but also far beyond its borders.  \\n✅ The wine is characterized by a beautiful straw yellow color. The refined, refined bouquet shows a bright, aromatic character, filled with accents of peaches, apricots and apples, which are emphasized by light notes of ginger, honey and herbs. Refreshing, elegant, rich and harmonious, the taste reveals a pleasant, balanced acidity.  \\nWine: Chotiashvili Khikhvi Rcheuli Qvevri, white-dry  \\nGrapes: Khikhvi  \\nRegion: Kakheti-Georgia  \\nProducer: Chotiashvili Winery  \\nStrength: 13%  \\nVolume: 0.75  \\nPrice-from 20 💲  \\n(DE)  \\n🥂 Chotiashvili Khikhvi Rcheuli Kvevri - ein exquisiter, leichter, erfrischender Wein, der aus dem leichten technischen Khikhvi hergestellt wird - einer alten autochthonen georgischen Sorte.  \\nℹKhikhvi ist eine sehr interessante Sorte, die sich zur Herstellung einer Vielzahl von Weinen eignet. Zum Beispiel können sowohl Trocken- als auch Dessertweine aus Khikhvi hergestellt werden, die in Kardanakhi gesammelt wurden. Dies ist eine äußerst seltene Eigenschaft, und von allen Kachetien gibt nur Khikhvi eine ähnliche Gelegenheit. Es kann lange Zeit im Weinberg nicht zusammengebaut bleiben, und dies ist auch von besonderer Bedeutung. In Khikhvi reichert sich Zucker in großen Mengen an, es gab Fälle, in denen sein Zuckergehalt 35% erreichte.  \\nKhikhvi-Wein hat reiche Mineraltöne und dies unterscheidet diese Sorte auch von anderen. Die erste Erwähnung dieser Traube stammt aus dem dritten Jahrhundert.  \\n🍇Der Weinberg, in dem die Reben wachsen, befindet sich in einem der beliebtesten Weinanbaugebiete Georgiens - Kachetien.  \\nDie Methode der Weinherstellung in speziellen Tonamphoren namens Kvevri gilt ebenfalls als einzigartig und uralt.  \\nDie Weinbereitung und Alterung des Getränks in Originalgefäßen, die unter die Erde gestellt werden, bewahrt seine Phenolizität im Wein, entfernt überschüssige Säure und verleiht einen unvergesslichen Geschmack und ein unvergessliches Aroma.  \\n👉Dieses raffinierte Getränk wurde von dem kleinen Weingut Chotiashvili kreiert, das trotz seines relativ jungen Alters nicht nur in Georgien, sondern auch weit über seine Grenzen hinaus bekannt ist.  \\n✅ Der Wein zeichnet sich durch einen schönen strohgelben Farbton aus. Das raffinierte, raffinierte Bouquet zeigt einen hellen, aromatischen Charakter, gefüllt mit Akzenten von Pfirsichen, Aprikosen und Äpfeln, die durch leichte Noten von Ingwer, Honig und Kräutern hervorgehoben werden. Erfrischend, elegant, reich und harmonisch, offenbart der Geschmack eine angenehme, ausgewogene Säure.  \\nWein: Chotiashvili Khikhvi Rcheuli Qvevri, weiß-trocken  \\nTrauben: Khikhvi  \\nRegion: Kachetien-Georgien  \\nProduzent: Chotiashvili Winery  \\nStärke: 13%  \\nVolumen: 0,75  \\nPreis-ab 20 💲 \\n\\n (RU)  \\n🥂 Чотиашвили Хихви Рчеули Квеври – изысканное, легкое, освежающее вино, которое создается из светлого технического сорта Хихви – который является древним автохтонным грузинским сортом.  \\nℹХихви – весьма интересный сорт, он подходит для изготовления разнообразных вин. К примеру, из Хихви, собранного в Карданахи может быть приготовлено как сухое, так и десертное вино. Это крайне редкое свойство и из всех кахетинских сортов лишь Хихви дает подобную возможность. Он может долго оставаться несобранным в винограднике, и это также имеет особое значение. В Хихви в большом количестве накапливаются сахара, бывали случаи, когда его сахаристость достигала 35%.  \\nВино Хихви обладает насыщенными минеральными тонами и это также отличает этот сорт от других. Первые упоминания об этом винограде дотированы еще третьим веком.  \\n🍇Виноградник, на котором произрастают лозы, расположен в одном из популярных винодельческих регионов Грузии – Кахетии.  \\nУникальным и древним также считается способ производства вина в специальных глиняных амфорах, которые называются ''Kвеври''.  \\nВинификация и выдержка напитка в оригинальных сосудах, которые помещены под землю, сохраняют в вине его фенольность, убирает лишнюю кислотность и придает незабываемый вкус и аромат.  \\n👉Создан этот утонченный напиток небольшой винодельней Чотиашвили , которая не взирая на достаточно молодой возраст, уже известна не только в Грузии, но и далеко за ее пределами.  \\n✅Вино характеризуется красивым соломенно-желтым оттенком. В утонченном, изысканном букете раскрывается яркий ароматический характер, наполненный акцентами персиков, абрикосов, яблок, которые подчеркнуты легкими оттенками имбиря, меда и трав.

'After a long time of personal effort, I\\'m pleased to announce that I\\'ve completed the first version of the app I\\'ve designed for Android devices. Its name is ***Wine Routes*** and it is designed as a tool for all wine lovers.\\n\\nThe idea originally came up while I was looking to find out about the wineries in Greece, their products and their location. Unfortunately, I found that the available data was inadequate and usually related to the popular wineries displayed on wine websites. This was the case until I discovered a PDO / PGI Winemaking Registry: a simple excel file with no mechanical readability of this public information, negating the possibility of being classified as \"open data\". So, I proceeded to a mass processing of the data of this Registry, with the harder point of manually locating each winery separately. It was a time-consuming task but led to a total of nearly 700 wineries with detailed data and geographic location. The next thought was: Who needs this data? Who wants to know where each winery is located? The answer was: whoever wants to visit the wineries.\\n\\nHere lies the central idea of the application: the winelover can browse the map, explore the wineries and plan a winery visit route or follow a proposed route. If he/she has visited wineries, he/she can record his/her view of them, as well as save his/her routes. Each route is designed, based on an algorithm, based on shortest distance or shorter duration. The long-term goal of the application is to promote wine tourism not only for the popular but for all wineries in Greece, giving the opportunity to show new winemakers as well as to promote the Greek wine worldwide as the application is not only for Greece but for all winelovers.\\n\\nThe app is officially released and available for free at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.phonegap.wineroutes(https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.phonegap.wineroutes).

Vintage Wine and Eats in Studio City answered my goals with their truly unique selection of wines. ⠀  \\n⠀  \\nI have never heard of a Semi-sparkling Orange Wine before and was overly excited to get this wine from Grace. From Northern Grace, Ioannina is a small wine region with only two wineries. Paleokerisio Meaning \"old fashioned\" revives the well-known traditional semi-sparkling wine of Ioannina. A blend of Indigenous grapes; Debina, Vlahiko, and Bekari. These grapes go through skin contact before fermentation, resulting in a light amber orange color. ⠀  \\n⠀  \\nIoannina is about 2300 feet above sea level on the western slopes of Pindos, these slops receive about 40 inches of rain, lucky for us the vineyards are mainly sunny with steeply inclined slopes, sandy loam soil and have outstanding natural drainage. ⠀  \\n⠀  \\n👀: Golden amber⠀  \\n⠀  \\n👃🏻: apple cider, Campari or amaro element like bitter orange and bittersweet herbs⠀  \\n⠀  \\n👅: baked pear/apple, orange peels, clove and mountain spices⠀  \\n⠀  \\nPaired this with Korean style meatballs, rice, and roasted vegetables. The herbs and sweet Korean BBQ sauce worked really while with the bubbles of the wine.⠀  \\n⠀  \\nHighly recommend trying this wine. ⠀  \\n⠀  \\n\\\\#greekwine(https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/greekwine/) \\\\#vinodegrecia(https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/vinodegrecia/) \\\\#vinosdegrecia(https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/vinosdegrecia/) \\\\#vinoimportado(https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/vinoimportado/) \\\\#glinavos(https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/glinavos/) \\\\#domaineglinavos(https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/domaineglinavos/) \\\\#paleokerisio(https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/paleokerisio/) \\\\#debina(https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/debina/) \\\\#vinosgriegos(https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/vinosgriegos/) \\\\#ioannina(https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/ioannina/) \\\\#glinavos(https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/glinavos/) \\\\#naturalwinelover(https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/naturalwinelover/) \\\\#winelover(https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/winelover/) \\\\#wine(https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/wine/) \\\\#winetasting(https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/winetasting/) \\\\#winelover(https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/winelover/) \\\\#orangewine(https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/orangewine/) \\\\#orangewines(https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/orangewines/) \\\\#vintage(https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/vintage/) \\\\#studiocitycalifornia(https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/studiocitycalifornia/) \\\\#vintagestudiocity(https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/vintagestudiocity/) \\\\#vintagewineandeats(https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/vintagewineandeats/) \\\\#wynobsession(https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/wynobsession/) \\\\#foodandwine(https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/foodandwine/) \\\\#foodandwinepairing(https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/foodandwinepairing/) \\\\#wineandfood(https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/wineandfood/) \\\\#instawine(https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/instawine/) \\\\#instafoodlover(https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/instafoodlover/) \\\\#instawinelover(https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/instawinelover/) \\\\#instawinelovers(https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/instawinelovers/) ⠀', 't2_2a4rmne8', 'Paleokerisio Orange Wine', 't3_e4mqaa', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/WineAndFood/comments/e4mqaa/paleokerisio_orange_wine/'), ('i8azvc', '2020-Aug-12 04:59', 'u_SFF_Georgia', 't5_2rpmwl', '&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2ftyu4fwnjg51.jpg?width=1564&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef834cbf3aec2beddb90336ab045a9e7dbec97ea\\n\\n \\n\\n(EN)  \\n🥂\"Qvevris\" Rkatsiteli from Tbilvino is a classic Georgian white wine made in accordance with the old traditions of Kakheti.  \\nℹ️The history of the Tbilvino company begins in 1️⃣9️⃣6️⃣2️⃣, when one of the most powerful wineries in the Soviet Union was launched at that time.  \\nIn 1️⃣9️⃣9️⃣0️⃣year, the plant turned into an independent wine-making company with a new philosophy and an innovative approach, which began the rapid development of both infrastructure and the increasing complexity of the wines presented.  \\nThe production of \\'\\'Rkatsiteli\\'\\' wine in Georgia began in 1️⃣9️⃣4️⃣3️⃣.  \\n🍇\\'\\'Rkatsiteli\\'\\' grapes grown in the areas of Kardenakhi, Tibaani, Tsinandali, Gurjaani and Napareuli are alcoholic fermented with stems, skin and seeds, as well as using French and German noble yeast cultures.  \\n👉 Qvevri clay vessels buried in the ground are used as containers.

Users can also view their routes and reviewed wineries on the map, thus creating a visualization of their trips.\\n* Winery profile is also enriched with much information as well as with the reviews created by all users for it or its wines.\\n* You can now choose among ten (10) languages: English, Greek, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Chinese and Japanese. The plan is to add more languages on a latter production stage.\\n* Filtering wineries on the map and the list is now also possible with basic attributes (name, country, region, visitable, number of reviews, review score, etc).\\n\\nSo, stay tuned to any new announcements till September 15th and join a growing *Wine Routes* community.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f1nanos6e1j31.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0dadc6f6ccbacef4ae77ee2df8477435caaa3f05\", 't2_172g8q', 'Wine Routes v.1.3 to be released on September 15th', 't3_cw8rkb', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/wineroutes/comments/cw8rkb/wine_routes_v13_to_be_released_on_september_15th/'), ('8yspsm', '2018-Jul-14 06:46', 'wine', 't5_2qhs8', 'So, I thought you might find some interior design inspiration from my home.\\n\\nAll the bookcases are just stacked on top of each other with the use of nothing but gravity and some small pieces of wood in the bottom to keep it all in level.

Let me warn you that the below is pure debauchery :)\\n\\nTwo years ago I had the honor of being attending a party for the 40th birthday and departure to the US of a wine connoisseur in Gevrey, France. Together with a friend we drove my old convertible through the French Jura, down from Geneva to Gevrey, where we started the day at the Rotisserie du Chambertin in Gevrey. We started with a vintage champagne, before moving on to a gorgeous Gevrey Chambertin 2009. We ended with a nice Givry en Veille Vignes, a 2013, young but promising.\\n\\nAfter this, we retired to the hotel to prepare for the evening. Our participatory gifts were 3 large boxes of Cuban Cigars, I had a selection of Swiss Pinot Noirs and my friend brought a vertical tasting of Chateauneuf du Pape, covering 9 years of which 3 were also horizontally covered. \\n\\nWe arrived at the old farm; the residence of our host and were greeted by a crowd of roughly 100 people; evenly split up between the largests winegrowing families of the region and winelovers from all over the world. Tables were laid out with tens of differents styles of cigards; others held massive buffets of cheese (whole wheels) and Charcuterie. But the most impressive sight we were greeted by was the 2 old convent tables, loaded down with hundreds of the best wines I have ever seen. Whites, Reds, Champagnes, French, Italian, ... everything was present and available, brought by the assorted guests ...\\n\\nThat night I got to drink, amongst others:\\n2004 Romanee-Conti\\n2011 Cuvee Emilie Hermitage\\n2012 No.3\\n1999 Chapelle-CHambertin Grand Cru Trapet\\n2009 Chablis Grand Cru Blanchot\\n2001 Visan La Tine\\n2006 Visan La Tine\\n1945 Barolo (drinkable!)\\n2011 Pessac-Leognan Grand Cru CLasse \\n1945 Alicante Montagnac\\n2007 Chevalier Montrachet Grand Cru ....\\n\\nThere were tens of other bottles there I did not drink from and at least 30 I did drink from, but have no pics of.

Thought it would be a good time with all the option drama. Morale of the post is the NFT market place will reach far beyond gaming. The gaming marketcap is not what RC has his eyes on. He is looking to take away the middle man in nearly every industry allowing indie people to actually make money on their value. Imagine a talented musician able to crowd source money for creation of an album by offering 50% of the final product as an NFT. The people holding the NFTs do not mind because they know the NFT goes up if album is good and the artist then takes home 50% profit instead of a 10% profit they would have gotten from an agency.\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\n# It takes money to buy whiskey\\n\\nSo, the below article goes into details regarding an NFT fund that is used to buy stakes in whiskey producing. The NFT’s are backed by actual whiskey. So as the whiskey ages the NFT’s gains value.\\n\\nBefore we dig into the meat and potatoes of this let’s get the tits jacked. See below piece. Notice anything????\\n\\nYou NEED MONEY TO BUY THE WHISKEY NFT. I think he was leading us to this article to help us understand what the hell GameStop will be doing, and it is freaking amazing and genius and every other good word that is in the dictionary.\\n\\nhttps://www.insidehook.com/article/booze/blockbar-nft-crypto-spirits-wine-marketplace(https://www.insidehook.com/article/booze/blockbar-nft-crypto-spirits-wine-marketplace)\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qyl9d4kic2081.png?width=903&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6693fe3904c5f9efc95f373381ee363c46acaf25\\n\\n# Why the hell would I want to invest in a whiskey NFT?\\n\\nTokenized whiskey? WTF is going on here? Well you see the whiskey starts off at 750-900$ per barrel then it can double, triple, quadruple, ect.. as time go by. So a group buys into the NFT to make the barrel and as time goes on the whiskey appreciates in value and so does your NFT. You can sell your stake in the whiskey process midway and double your money. The next person can sit on it for a few months and make gains as well.\\n\\nSo he is trying to tell you that you can do the same thing. To easily understand this, you can invest in an NFT game with a group of investors. Let’s say you and a group of other investors raise $100,000 for the project and you believe the game will be a huge success so you hold onto to your NFT while the game is being produced. Well at any time in production you can sell your stake in the game for a profit. The game will age just like whiskey. If it’s from a good producer, it will be a great investment.\\n\\nWell, what does GameStop bring to the table in this regard? They will be the marketplace for game developers to sell their NFTs so they can work independently with crowdsourced money. As the whiskey article explains, the NFT allows the asset to be more liquid which brings in more investors. You may not want to invest in an NFT project if it may be hard to sell out at anytime due to limited buyers but with GameStop’s NFT marketplace you will be able to trade your stakes in these NFTs at anytime through this interconnected hub with millions of other investors or collectors. The liquidity is what will drive in investors in droves knowing it’s easy to backout if you don’t think it is going anywhere and it will be easy for investors who think the project will be going to the stars to buy in from someone with a more bearish opinion then them. This will be a place where diamond hands thrive.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2hhtv0rmc2081.png?width=882&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6766aa9267538e4f02d60c94a9c1c10fe3c2ffe\\n\\n# Flappy Bird (forgot this in orginal post)\\n\\nRemember the game Flappy Bird? That game was a huge success and made by one developer. It was making 50 grand a day with advertisements alone. So, imagine investing in some random developer to make a game. You and ten other investors invest a grand and receive an NFT as your token of ownership of the game. The game developer owns a portion of the NFTs and GameStop owns some portions of the NFTs. This game then becomes a huge success like flappy bird. You may have just turned your 1000$ into a million dollars. And the brilliant game developer that no one recognizes gets to walk away with bank due to crowd sourcing. He would have never gotten the chance if it wasn’t for you.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b4siooipc2081.png?width=1013&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1663c0e0a620dacdb68d51afd2aebab4ee647950\\n\\n# Music\\n\\nLet’s take this to another layer. Say a musician wants to create an album but needs funding to do so. Instead of signing a crappy ass record label and getting screwed in the long run, they can sell a piece of their ownership of the final product to the marketplace crowd. The music creator says I need 50K to get this album out the door. I will give 50% ownership of this album to whoever pays me 50 grand. Multiple investors can chip away at this piece of the pie. GameStop will be the mediator that allows investor to meet creator and take a small gain to keep the market place growing.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/udhv0t7wc2081.png?width=828&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b91757ed8a2660a332e8d54805430c36a7e2270e\\n\\n# Art, Film, Clothes Designing, New Ideas, ect…\\n\\nSo you see where this is going? This is much bigger than games. If they secure a marketplace that is fluent and attracts a lot of people, brilliant minds will stop going to companies that f\\\\*ck them for money but will negotiate with everyday people for fund sourcing for their dreams. They will not have to please their bosses but would rather please their fans and be able to be createlike never before. AKA power to the creators. And the beauty of an NFT is that they can remain completely anonymous while they do this. GAME ON ANON.\\n\\n# GameStop Merger\\n\\nGameStop has been posting bullish job postings with M&amp;A requirements (merger and acquisitions), ERP transitions, carve outs, ect… Some People were speculating a spin off by I don’t agree.\\n\\nSee below the two job postings I found real quick from searching.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aaj83jqyc2081.png?width=812&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd90bca039ab5f2dcbcc755ad1b337779394a3ad\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/880m2s30d2081.png?width=890&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2132e388b8158694a5e77c344ec665f749c3d9ab\\n\\nOne shows a system carve out which some pointed out to as being a split off aka GameStop NFT splitting off and becoming it’s own company but I don’t think this is the case. Remember guys Power to the players is GameStop. Their NFT website says Power to the creators, Power to the players and Power to the collectors. This absolutely leads me to believe that they are not splitting off. The below snip is from https://www.gambit.de/en/carve-out-en/(https://www.gambit.de/en/carve-out-en/). It explains how a system carve out is also needed in a merger.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/441h1kh6d2081.png?width=887&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57903faf8c3e0f9a2dc8ce0ca39deface282458a\\n\\n# What do both job postings listed above have in common? Merger and acquisition.\\n\\nI work for a business that recently did a merger and I can give our timeline to estimate a GME merger timeline. Employees were informed of the merger in March of 2020. The CEO of the company we merged with talked with us and talked about the merger process. He had been knowing about the merger since the summer before. So, there was ongoing negotiations for 3-9 months prior to the announcement.\\n\\nWe know GME hired Matt Finestone in early Summer so if there was negotiations with Loopring, they would be well underway. I’m not saying Loopring is the absolute choice but I know it’s who I would pick.\\n\\nGme merging with LoopRing would benefit both GameStop and Loopring. GameStop has the loyal supporters and large customer base. Loopring has the intellectual property which would prevent anyone from copying GameStop’s system. Both together would dominate the future. GameStop is ahead of where everything is going and Loopring has the key to lock up the market for years.\\n\\nBack to the merger. Following the announcement, the shareholders would have to vote on yay or nay on the merger.\\n\\nOnce shareholders vote yes on the merger, the companies would then set a date on when the merger will be official. The value of both companies will be combined, and there will be a new price per share. It’s possible there could be share splits or reverse splits for GameStop owners. GameStop could also elect to change the name of the company if they would like.\\n\\nSo once they announce the merger, there is a period of time before the merger actually happens. People will be flocking to GME stock left and right to be part of the future. Buy what you can now if you like the company. We may never see 200$ or even 300$ again after the announcement.\\n\\n# TLDR: POWER TO THE PLAYERS, POWER TO THE CREATORS, POWER TO THE COLLECTORS\\n\\nThis is the most genius slogan I can think of. GME is about to literally change the way shit works. Say goodbye to the mainstream. They are putting the power into the people rather than the big shitty corporations.\\n\\nThey will connect everyone, and this slogan says it all. Think about it. How do you cater to different players of games? Some people want a sports game but would also maybe like to have guns and sharks with laser beams in it. Well maybe they pitch the idea in GameStop’s marketplace. A creator comes in and says if the players can raise “x” amount of capital, they will create it for them. The collectors see this and think wow let me get a piece of that because that may be valuable one day. The creator makes it; the players and collectors pay for it and the game ages like fine whiskey. It takes money to buy whiskey!!!!! The below link is to an article explaining how investors can buy an NFT of whiskey and watch it appreciate over time. The whiskey is backed by actual aging whiskey like how GME NFT will be backed by actual projects such as games, music, art, new ideas ect…The article also explains how investors have to put up a lot of money for the project but can be rewarded up to five times they paid in a couple years.\\n\\nhttps://www.insidehook.com/article/booze/whiskey-fund-tokenize(https://www.insidehook.com/article/booze/whiskey-fund-tokenize)\\n\\nThis extends to art, music, movies, whiskey, etc… The NFT aspect attracts all investors since it is easy to buy and sell or aka have liquidity. GameStop works with LoopRing and gains exclusive access to their patents which makes Ethereum usable in a marketplace and also eliminates front running which attracts every day investors since they know they will not be fx'd over. Talented game developers work independently with maybe other creators and can make maximum profit rather than shitty CEO’s and executives taking the money. They are more motivated which equates to better games.\\n\\n**PS:** I believe Gamestop will merge with LoopRing. I think the contract is underway and that will be the first thing that will be announced. I’ve just been through a merger, and I can feel it in my balls that GME and LoopRing are currently negotiating. It takes a lot of planning for a merger but they usually announce it months before it actually happens. Negotiate for 3-6 months then announce the merger. The actual merger can take up to another 6 months to actually take place. People will be buying GME shares like crazy to be a part of the new company forming before it happens.\\n\\nWith that I will say we do not need to worry about a catalyst to force shorts to cover because GME business transformation is the actual golden ticket. I’m not going to speak for you but I would respect GameStop much more for spending their money and time wisely creating the new frontier that will dominate the global market rather than an NFT that will not secure their future. Other companies are building metaverses such as Facebook. To you Ryan Cohen and GME personnel, do what you gotta do to beat the competition.\\n\\nGME at a 2 trillion market cap would make you 200 times the amount of money you are seeing in your portfolio. The MOASS will happen along the way but also know that GameStop doesn't need shorts to bring it to the moon because they are doing it behind the scenes without the fuckup that shorters created.

Over the next few days gifts shall be exchanged. I think I’m safe in assuming that whiskey will be quite a popular gift. Maybe you’ve bought some for someone. Maybe you’ll receive some from someone. Either way, if you’re not too sure what the hype is for expensive barrel juice I thought I’d give you a quick run down on what is it, where it came from, and some general info you can use to talk shite to your relatives as you sip your drams over the festive period.\\n\\nAs a bit of background, I’ve been in the industry for about a decade. I worked in sales first (if you ever bought whiskey in Dublin Airport you may have chatted to me).  I moved into being a whiskey guide then a brand ambassador and by grace of God I got into production just before the pandemic hit which has kept me in a stable job.\\n\\nI won’t say where I’m working specifically as I want to be open enough and not brand focused when talking about the different types.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#**What is Irish Whiskey?**\\n\\nThere is a clunky definition, but Irish Whiskey is a spirit distilled on the Island of Ireland, (including Northern Ireland), from a mash of malted cereals with or without whole grains of other cereals and which has been:\\n\\n* saccharified by the diastase of malt contained therein, with or without other natural enzymes;\\n\\n* fermented by the action of yeast;\\n\\n* distilled at an alcoholic strength of less than 94.8% by volume in such a way that the distillate has an aroma and taste derived from the materials used;\\n\\n* subject to the maturation of the final distillate for at least three years in wooden casks, such as oak, not exceeding 700 litres capacity.\\n\\nEssentially, Irish whiskey must be made on the island of Ireland, must be made with malted grains (plus unmalted if you want). It can’t be stronger than 94.8% abv, and it must spend at least 3 years in a wooden cask which doesn’t exceed 700 litres.\\n\\nThat’s pretty much it. There are other \\\\*traditions\\\\* that are associated with Irish Whiskey, but they aren’t rules. I’ll talk about them in a bit.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#**Styles of Irish Whiskey.**\\n\\nDo you have a bottle of whiskey near you? Take a look at it. The label should specify the style of whiskey that it is. Irish whiskey will fall into 4 main categories:\\n\\nMalt Whiskey – Whiskey made exclusively with malted barley\\n\\nPot Still Whiskey – Whiskey made with a combination of malted and unmalted barley (this style is unique to Ireland).\\n\\nGrain Whiskey – whiskey that contains malted barley, but also a separate grain altogether. This is commonly corn but rye, oats, and wheat can also be used.\\n\\nBlended Whiskey – Any combination of the above three styles that have been mixed together before bottling.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#**Production.**\\n\\nI won’t get too technical, and I’ll speak on very general terms but making whiskey is quite straightforward.\\n\\nMalt whiskey and Pot Still whiskey are produced in a near identical way. The only difference is that malt whiskey uses exclusively malted barley, whereas Pot Still whiskey uses a combination of malted and unmalted barley.\\n\\nBarley in its natural state is unmalted. Its full of complex sugars which makes it very tough. For fermentation to work, these sugars must be broken down into simple sugars. This is done by allowing the barley to germinate for a few days. As the barley germinates, the seeds will digest the starches and break them down into simple sugars. This makes the now malted barley more brittle and sweet.\\n\\nOn that note, here is a quickfire general overview of how whiskey is made:\\n\\n1. Mill the barley into a flour\\n2. Mix the flour with water, creating a sugary soup\\n3. Filter the soup and retain the liquid\\n4. Throw yeast into the sugary liquid and allow it to ferment\\n5. After a few days, we have a rudimentary hopless beer with a strength of 8-12% abv\\n6. Throw the beer into a copper pot still and heat it up.\\n7. Alcohol vaporizes at 78ish degrees Celsius which is lower than water’s boiling point. By distilling carefully, we can separate a lot of the alcohol and water.\\n8. In Ireland, this is often done 3 times (but not always)\\n9. Post distillation we are left with something called New Make Spirit. It is very strong, often 80 something%\\n10. Dilute this down to roughly 60% and put it in a wooden barrel in a warehouse. Wait at least three years.\\n11. As the seasons change, the liquid will interact with the wood of the barrel. Expansion and contraction encourage flavours from the barrel to impart themselves into the liquid. Often, Irish distilleries will use barrels that have previously held different types of alcohol so remnants of these flavours will also impart themselves to the whiskey. Ex-bourbon and ex-wine barrels are the most common.\\n12. After (At least) 3 years empty your barrel and now you have whiskey\\n\\n\\nGrain whiskey is often made slightly differently with the main difference being that a different grain is used, and usually the product is distilled through something called a column still instead of a copper pot still. It’s a bit complicated so I’m gonna dutifully skip over that bit, but grain whiskey will go into a barrel just like the other styles.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#**Quickfire FAQ**\\n\\n---\\n\\n*History*\\n\\n**What is the etymology of ‘whiskey’?**\\n\\nThe word whiskey is derived from the Classical Gaelic ‘Uisce Beatha’ which itself is a translation of the Latin ‘Aqua Vitae’ both of which mean ‘Water of Life’. The term was translated into English and was known as *usquebaugh*, eventually evolving into ‘Whiskey’\\n\\n**Did Ireland or Scotland invent whiskey?**\\n\\nImpossible to determine with accuracy as distillation has been around for millennia. From a historical perspective, current research notes that the first mention of aqua vitae was from 1405 with regards to an Irish chieftain’s funeral, it may have also been mentioned a few decades earlier within the Red Book of Ossory so it's chronologically ours. I suppose we can claim that for now.\\n\\n**Why is whiskey spelled with an E in Ireland?**\\n\\nThis is a tradition, not a rule. Many older bottles of Irish whiskey will be spelled without the E. It’s generally accepted that Dublin distilleries in the 19th century began to spell the product with an E as a way of differentiating it from Scottish and other Irish distilleries, as Dublin whiskey was perceived as being of a higher quality at the time.\\n\\n**When was Irish whiskey’s Golden Age?**\\n\\nProbably the 19th century. Hugely popular. Outproducing the rest of the world combined. The biggest distillery at the time was the George Roe distillery. The current Roe &amp; Coe whiskey is produced in the same area as the original distillery, but it is a new operation, as the original Roe distillery closed in the 1920s. Jameson in Smithfield and Powers in Thomas street were the two other major distilleries in Dublin.\\n\\n**Why did the Golden Age end?**\\n\\nA huge number of reasons. The first half of the 20th century was a terrible time for Irish whiskey. Temperance movements became more popular in Ireland at the turn of the 20th century. WWI caused logistical issues with export. Irish independence created trade wars with the UK which meant we lost trade with our nearest neighbour and the commonwealth. The Americans brought in prohibition, WWII caused more logistical problems. By 1966, plans were made to close 2 of Dublin’s last great distilleries - Jameson and Powers. They were consolidated into Irish Distillers and moved to Midleton, Cork. By 1975 no more whiskey was being made in the city that had been the global centre of whiskey less than a century before.\\n\\n**Has Irish whiskey recovered?**\\n\\nIt’s doing exceptionally well. There are new distilleries popping up every year in Ireland. In terms of market share, it still lags far behind Scotland, but the industry is growing. Teeling began distilling in Dublin again in 2015, which ended over 40 years of production hiatus in the capital. Since then, a number of other distilleries have begun to operate in Dublin.\\n\\n**How many distilleries are in Ireland today?**\\n\\nJust over 30. This includes those who are waiting for their first whiskey to mature. Just under 20 more are currently under construction or have planning approved. For comparison, there were only three distilleries open on this island until 2007. Compared to Scotland, Ireland still lags behind, with the Scottish having over 130 operating distilleries. \\n\\n---\\n\\n*Production*\\n\\n**Why barley?**\\n\\nGreat for producing fermentable malted grain which makes it efficient for producing alcohol. Also grows abundantly in Ireland.\\n\\n**Why do you put unmalted barley in Pot Still whiskey if it can’t be fermented?**\\n\\nIt gives the whiskey a spicy, full bodied, creamier flavour.\\n\\n**What type of yeast is used?**\\n\\nDifferent distilleries will experiment with different yeasts but from my experience, *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* is the most common strain used.\\n\\n**Can you drink the beer that is produced before distillation?**\\n\\nThe beer is called wash, can be quite strong, and it contains no hops. It is an acquired taste…\\n\\n**Why are the stills made of copper?**\\n\\nIt’s relatively cheap, it’s malleable, it’s a good heat conductor, it’s relatively easy to clean.\\n\\n**Does all Irish whiskey get distilled three times?**\\n\\nMost but not all. A lot of the whiskey made in the Cooley distillery has been distilled twice.\\n\\n**Why distill three times?**\\n\\nThe more you distill, the smoother it gets.\\n\\n**Why not distill four times then?**\\n\\nThe more you distill, the less you retain. Distilling four times is not commercially viable.\\n\\n**But is there a whisk(e)y that has been distilled four times?**\\n\\nThe only quadruple distilled whisky I’ve come across from an established distillery are a few expressions from the Bruichladdich distillery in Scotland. \\n\\n\\n**What wood are the barrels made from?**\\n\\nOak is the most common. It is a style of wood that allows a lot of interaction between liquid and wood. Chestnut and acacia wood have been used, but they are rare.\\n\\n**Do Irish distilleries make their own barrels?**\\n\\nFor the vast vast majority, no. Irish distilleries tend to import previously used barrels to age our whiskey. What this does is that it allows flavours that have already imprinted on the wood to impart their character on the Irish whiskey. The two most common types of ex-cask the industry uses are ex-bourbon barrels from the USA and ex-fortified wine casks from the Sherry and Port regions of Iberia.\\n\\nBourbon barrels often give whiskey a caramel vanilla essence\\n\\nThe ex-wine barrels impart more fruity, full bodied notes to the final product.\\n\\nOther casks are becoming more common. Jameson caskmates range finish their whiskey in stout or IPA casks.\\n\\nSometimes virgin oak is used which will give its own unique flavour to the whiskey.\\n\\nTeeling whiskey are quite experimental with non-fortified wine casks, such as standard red and white casks. I think they had a whiskey which was aged in cognac casks too.\\n\\n**Does all of the whiskey remain in the barrel throughout maturation?**\\n\\nNo. Roughly 2% penetrates the wood annually and evaporates. This is called the Angel’s Share. It is one of the reasons older whiskey is more expensive. By the time the cask is opened, there is simply less of it left.\\n\\n**How do distilleries stay afloat for the first three years if they cannot release whiskey?**\\n\\nAlthough whiskey cannot be released if it is under three years old, gin and poitín can be released immediately. Sometimes distilleries allow people to invest in barrels before they’re opened in order to raise capital too. \\n\\n\\n**My bottle says ‘Single’ on it what does this mean?**\\n\\nYour bottle may say something like ‘single grain’, ‘single malt’, or ‘single pot still’.\\n\\nThe world single means the whiskey was made at one single distillery. Some whiskey is produced by mixing different styles from different distilleries. Tullamore D.E.W did this between their original distillery closing and a new one opening recently.\\n\\nInterestingly, blended whiskey like Jameson is made in a single location, so it is technically a ‘single blend’ but this is confusing, so you won’t see it written on the bottles.\\n\\n**Does whiskey age in the bottle?**\\n\\nNo. Once the whiskey is bottled, it stops aging. A 12 year old whiskey will always be a 12 year old whiskey no matter how long you keep it.\\n\\n**Does the barrel influence the colour of the whiskey?**\\n\\nYes. The longer the whiskey is in the barrel, the more dark it will become. However, many distilleries utilise a loophole and add caramel colouring to the whiskey to artificially darken it. This is done for consistency, and more marketing purposes. So always be sceptical of the colour of whiskey unless the explicitly tell you it does not use artificial colouring.\\n\\n**What strength is whiskey?**\\n\\nMost standard whiskey is sold around 40-45% abv. Generally speaking, after distillation, we have a pure smooth alcohol of around 85%. Purified water is added bringing it down to 63.5%. This is the strength that works best for interaction with the wood. Over time, as whiskey evaporates the alcohol will disappear at a slightly faster rate than the water. After maturation, the whiskey can still be around 55-60% so more water is added to dilute it to a more palatable level. If your bottle says ‘cask strength’, this means that this final dilution has not taken place and the whiskey will be quite strong.\\n\\n**What are some examples of the different styles of Irish whiskey?**\\n\\nObviously non exhaustive, but just to give you an idea if you ever want to compare and contrast:\\n\\n* Grain:Teeling Single Grain\\n\\n* Malt: Bushmills 16 years\\n\\n* Pot Still: Redbreast 12\\n\\n* Grain + Malt blend: Bushmills original\\n\\n* Grain + Pot still blend: Jameson Original\\n\\n* Malt + Pot Still blend: Writer’s Tears Copper Pot\\n\\n* Grain + Malt + Pot Still: Tullamore D.E.W 12 years\\n\\n---\\n\\n*International styles*\\n\\n**What other countries make whiskey?**\\n\\nA huge amount. The most popular other countries that produce whiskey are Scotland, USA, Japan, Canada but most alcohol producing nations also have at least one whiskey distillery today. India makes a very high amount of what they call whisky, but it relies on fermented molasses instead of grain, so it does not reach the Irish definition for whiskey. \\n\\n**Why is Scottish Whisky smoky?**\\n\\nScotland produces huge amounts of whisky but can often have a reputation for producing smoke/peated whisky.\\n\\nMost Scottish whisky with these tasting notes comes from the island of Islay (visible from the North on a clear day).\\n\\nWhen barley is being malted, in order to stop the germination, the barley gets heated. In Islay, this is done by burning peat and turf. The smoke flavours are taken by the barley through the whole production process.\\n\\nThe majority of Scottish whiskey does not in fact have a smoky flavour. Likewise there are some Irish whiskey expressions that do use peated barley.\\n\\n**What are some other traditional differences between Irish whiskey and Scottish whisky?**\\n\\n* Ireland tends to distill 3 times (with exception). Scotland tends to distill 2 times (with exception).\\n\\n* Ireland produces Pot Still whiskey, Scotland does not.\\n\\n* The spelling.\\n\\n* Wheat is a bit more commonplace in Scotland\\n\\n* Scotland is a bit more regional when it comes to making their malt whisky. There are 5 regions of Scottish malt whisky. they are Campbeltown, Highland, Islay, Lowland and Speyside. Each of these regions follow certain traditions and methods in making whisky which makes their products unique. There are exceptions of course but most of the distilleries in these distinct regions will have a lot in common with each other.\\n\\n**What about American whiskey?**\\n\\nCompared to Scotland/Ireland, USA whiskey is quite different.\\n\\nGenerally speaking, grain whiskey is a lot more common in the USA as corn is a more abundant grain. Rye is also quite popular.\\n\\nThe most famous style of American whiskey is bourbon. There are a number of rules associated with bourbon but some of the more well known ones are:\\n\\n* It must be aged at least 2 years (but often is aged over 4)\\n\\n* It must be made with at least 51% corn\\n\\n* It must be aged in a fresh charred American white oak barrel.\\n\\nThe fact that it must be aged in a new barrel is wonderful for Irish and Scottish distilleries as there is a constant export market from the USA to Ireland/Scotland. There are no such laws about fresh barrels over here so we often reuse these barrels numerous times.\\n\\n**And Japanese?**\\n\\nKnown for it’s high quality, Japanese whisky is superficially similar to Scottish whisky. They spell it the same way, they also often double distill, and they tend to focus on barley-based whisky.\\n\\nAlthough Japan has made whisky for over a century, they invested heavily in the industry in the 90s. This means that they have some premium age statements being released today. \\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n*Tasting*\\n\\n**What is the correct way to taste whiskey?**\\n\\nPretty much any way you want. I’d advise that if you want to taste the whiskey, don’t shoot it. Have a smell of it first (keep your mouth open while smelling).\\n\\nHave a sip and get the mouthfeel for a few seconds.\\n\\nTo prevent afterburn, just after you swallow, gently exhale to expel the vapours.\\n\\n**Should I put ice in the whiskey?**\\n\\nIf you want. My only suggestion is that the colder something is, the less you taste of it. If you prefer whiskey with ice that’s perfect but I’d always recommend trying whiskey first at room temperature. After that, it’s completely up to you.\\n\\n**Should I use a mixer with my whiskey?**\\n\\nAgain, up to you. However I would say that if you are going to use a mixer with more expensive whiskey, this would more than likely be a waste. Any subtle notes in the whiskey will be drowned out completely by a mixer so my recommendation is using cheaper whiskey if you plan on mixing, but again – it’s up to you.\\n\\n**Barley is used, but is whiskey safe for those with coeliac disease?**\\n\\nWhiskey is safe to drink as glutens do not pass the distillation process. \\n\\n**What do the styles of whiskey taste like?**\\n\\nThis is very subjective so I can’t speak for everyone. Also remember that the type of barrel used will have more of an influence on the flavour, but using my own palate as a reference:\\n\\n* Grain: floral, delicate, light, and sweet (if corn is used), spicy, dry, and peppery (if rye is used).\\n\\n\\n* Malt: A mellow sweetness. Similar to toffee, smooth and a bit richer than grain. \\n\\n\\n* Pot Still: Spicy, creamy, rich, and full bodied. \\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n\\nThat’s pretty much it from me. Thanks for reading my essay. If this dies on it’s arse in /r/ireland/new/ that’s no problem but I’ll be checking in over the next few days to answer any questions that you have.\\n\\nI will finally point out that my goal was to give a general overview and confusingly there are exceptions to almost every tradition or process that I’ve mentioned. So the above is accurate in a wide-range way but no doubt there will be certain whiskey out there that won’t follow exactly what I’ve said above.\\n\\nMerry Christmas and happy drinking one and all.\", 't2_bw6hewke', 'Irish Whiskey.

The original bartender who took my order took my card never had me sign anything or gave me a receipt, handed the card back to me, then ignored me to take several other orders (it was super crowded). The manager was intoxicated I\\'m pretty sure and told me \"we will fix it, what\\'s the name on your card?\" They couldn\\'t find it in the system. He told me \"that must mean they already cancelled it so no worries, plus it\\'s just pending so it\\'s not actually out. Don\\'t worry my computer guy is coming\". Then the manager disappears and does not help me further basically saying oh well. \\n\\nI wake up today to another charge on that card from *today* for that bar for $45. I did not make a second charge with this card (considering they literally overdrafted me the last time I used it). \\n\\nWhat can I do here? I am already dealing with a dispute from a hotel on my credit card, is having two disputes going on SUS? How do I get my now $300+ for my single vodka Red Bull back?? I know I can contact the bar again but they were so unhelpful last night that I feel they will be useless. I was not drunk and I had 6 friends with me as \"witnesses\" and none of them got overcharged. \\n\\nIt is still in pending so theres a chance this gets taken off I guess but I\\'m just trying to think of what I should do next and freaking out a bit :\\')', 't2_9br28bx2', 'Went to a bar, bought one vodka Red Bull, got charged $275', 't3_yzh06k', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/yzh06k/went_to_a_bar_bought_one_vodka_red_bull_got/'), ('m6g4vw', '2021-Mar-16 13:43', 'WTF', 't5_2qh61', '', 't2_104lfa', 'What to do in Russia when you out of vodka and there is no bears nearby to fight', 't3_m6g4vw', 'https://v.redd.it/d8mvesseqfn61'), ('q3chmt', '2021-Oct-07 11:13', 'funny', 't5_2qh33', '', 't2_bw1crbei', 'A woman ask a man, \"Why not write \"smoking kills\" on Vodka\".', 't3_q3chmt', 'https://v.redd.it/hm1m6wppy1s71'), ('v789a7', '2022-Jun-07 16:29', 'LosAngeles', 't5_2qht0', '', 't2_15la77', 'Two Guys Selling Vodka at Costco, Hawthorne, CA - 6/7/22', 't3_v789a7', 'https://i.redd.it/8p1a9lcyo9491.jpg'), ('pcs9u9', '2021-Aug-27 12:46', 'WTF', 't5_2qh61', '', 't2_8dssbl6i', 'Vodka and coke russian style', 't3_pcs9u9', 'https://v.redd.it/nwd5vqsytxj71'), ('12fgc8c', '2023-Apr-08 03:59', 'CasualUK', 't5_3j2jr', '', 't2_rry02', 'These drink prices at the O2 arena last night, a single vodka was £12', 't3_12fgc8c', 'https://i.imgur.com/XcJNius.jpg'), ('sqq7e2', '2022-Feb-12 06:11', 'trees', 't5_2r9vp', '', 't2_23bi9at6', 'Found this cannabis infused vodka, 4 years since it was bottled.

Three weeks after Samantha\\'s birth, her mom filed for divorce. Michael says she dragged out the divorce, hiring and firing over 20 lawyers.\\n\\nBy the time Samantha was 11 months old, Ann had taken Samantha to 7 doctors 33 times. The doctors found no health problems. As a result, a psychiatrist ended up testifying that Ann had Munchausen\\'s Syndrome by Proxy, a rare psychiatric disorder where someone makes someone else who is under their care sick, to get attention.\\n\\nAnn began to accuse Michael of abusing their daughter whenever they spent time together. Michael said, \"Every time I would drop off Samantha she\\'d go to the police and say I abused \\\\Samantha\\\\.\" Authorities looked into the allegations but determined they were unfounded. The psychiatrist, given that he believed Ann had Munchausen\\'s Syndrome by Proxy, believed it was in Samantha\\'s best interest for her father to have custody of her and for Ann to receive supervised visits.\\n\\n**Abduction**\\n\\nAs part of a court ordered overnight visit/visitation exchange, Michael handed over his then 2 year old daughter to a police officer at the New Hyde Park PD in New York. It was during this night, 3 February 2001 (some sources say 4 February 2001) that she was abducted by her mother. Samantha is listed as being missing from Suffern, New York, where her father was living at the time.\\n\\nMichael and Ann were scheduled to appear the next day in court for a divorce hearing but she never showed up and has never been seen since. A felony warrant was issued for Ann on 15 February 2001. She had other warrants on charges of custodial interference, unauthorized use of a motor vehicle, and unlawful flight to avoid prosecution. They were possibly in the company of an adult female relative and may have traveled to New York City. They may have been traveling with their family dog, as 12 lb miniature red Tibetan Spaniel or Terrier, named Vodka. Ann may use glasses when driving and it\\'s thought that she may have been abusing Samantha prior to her disappearance.\\n\\nThe pair were initially traveling in a black, four door, 1996 Suzuki Sidekick Sport with a gold bumper and New York license plates. However, this car was found in a parking garage in Brooklyn, New York, 2 months after Samantha\\'s abduction. Samantha\\'s hair and fingerprints were found in the vehicle, but there was nothing to indicate where they might have gone to next.\\n\\n**Investigation**\\n\\nInvestigators found that in the weeks prior to Samantha\\'s disappearance, Ann had been loading up on prepaid calling cards at a convenience store, and stopped using her cell phone and credit cards.\\n\\nAuthorities believe the two may still be in New York City, or otherwise in Palm Beach County or Boynton Beach, Florida, or also in Illinois, or New Hampshire.\\n\\nThere were unconfirmed but thought to be credible sightings of the two in New Mexico in 2006. Kavin Gallagher, a lawyer and friend of Michael, visited Santa Fe, once in February and once in September. He distributed missing child flyers and talked to 6 witnesses who said they were certain they\\'d seen the two at a mall, a doctor\\'s office, and other locations. They saw a quiet, withdrawn girl and took note that her mother didn\\'t interact with her a lot. In 2006, Samantha would be  7 years old.\\n\\nThere were unconfirmed but thought to be credible sightings of the two in New Mexico in 2006.

They saw a quiet, withdrawn girl and took note that her mother didn\\'t interact with her a lot. In 2006, Samantha would be  7 years old.\\n\\nTwo warrants were issued for Ann Yermak\\'s arrest. One federal warrant is for charges of unlawful flight to avoid prosecution and the other was issued by the Ramapo Justice Court which alleges custodial interference in the first degree.

It\\'s like they believe getting hammered is a necessary rite of passage for me to become an adult. So this weekend at one of my friends\\' birthday party, I came across an empty bottle of vodka while I was alone in the kitchen and an idea struck me. I filled it up with water, and I rubbed actual vodka all over the top of the bottle and the hand with which I was holding it. I took a glass with 1/4 orange juice and joined the others.

I downed it and made a face like ugh, disgusting.\\n\\nA friend laughed and came over to sniff the bottle and he was virtually slapped in the nostrils by the smell of the alcohol from my hand and the top of the bottle.

I almost drank all of it, when one of them literally jumped on me and punched the bottle out of my hand. It fell to the floor and broke. Then, another couple of them started freaking out calling me an idiot, saying *ohmygod ohmygod ohmygod call the ambulance, he\\'s going to kill himsel!!!* and so on. Within 15 seconds, everyone was in panic mode, so I decided that was enough and I told them it was water. I said I found an empty bottle and put water in it, I wasn\\'t going to die and nobody needs to call the ambulance.\\n\\nThey. Fucking. Lost. It. I don\\'t think even my mom shouted at me as much as some of them did. Everyone was so upset that they turned off the music and just sat there pouting and yelling at me in intervals. A few of the girls told me to go fuck myself and went home, and the party was over. Only two guys told me to ignore the rest of them and said \"you got us good\".\\n\\nSince it happened, I\\'ve been shunned during lunch at college, and the two girls that were the most upset left me on seen when I sent them an apology on Facebook.

Also, a gin &amp; tonic. \\n\\nM: No problem, I can go ahead and put that in for you. What kind of gin would you like? -I gesture to our full bar and tell her some of our top shelf- \\n\\nL: Well, what's in a gin and tonic? \\n\\nM: Gin and tonic water, ma'am. \\n\\nL: Is it citrusy? \\n\\nM: We can add a lemon or lime twist, if you like.\\n\\nL: No, I want to know if it's citrusy. \\n\\nM: If you want it to be citrusy. \\n\\nL: Well, what's in it? \\n\\nM: Just gin and tonic water. \\n\\nL: Are you sure? \\n\\n--at this point I'm thoroughly confused and am doubting my own knowledge of a gin and tonic so I check with the bartender (it's just gin and tonic water, right?), to which she tells me yes, and I tell her I'll explain later-- \\n\\nM: Ma'am, I just checked with the bartender and a gin and tonic is only gin and tonic water. \\n\\nL: Well, could I get sprite in my gin and tonic? \\n\\nM: Sure, I could get you a gin and sprite. Would you like a garnish? \\n\\nL: No, I want a gin and tonic, but with sprite. \\n\\nM: Okay, no problem. Would you like a garnish? \\n\\nL: Will it be citrusy with the Sprite? \\n\\nM: Sprite is a lemon-lime soda, but you could still add a lemon or lime twist. \\n\\nL: Hmm okay. \\n\\nM: Would you like me to go ahead and ring that in for you?\\n\\nL: Actually, could I get the gin and tonic with vodka and sprite? \\n\\nM: So you'd like a vodka-sprite? \\n\\nL: No. I want a gin and tonic with vodka and sprite. \\n\\nM: Okay...\\n\\nL: Will that be citrusy? \\n\\nM: It is if you want it to be. \\n\\nL: I just don't understand what that means. \\n\\nM: Do you want lemon or lime? \\n\\nL: Both \\n\\nM: Okay so a gin and tonic with vodka and sprite, add lemon and lime. \\n\\nL: Actually, I'll just have the regular gin and tonic with no lemon or lime. \\n\\nM: Are you sure? \\n\\nL: Yes \\n\\n\\n\\nA little summary of the rest of the night: I bring her the regular gin and tonic and it is apparently exactly what she wanted. She also was (unsurprisingly) difficult when I tried to get her food order (repeatedly asked for pine nuts, which we don't have, and asked me to check with the kitchen, which I didn't do because we have never had pine nuts) and ended up not eating her food because it was apparently wrong (I put it in exactly how she ordered it) and only drank two or three sips of the gin and tonic. I kept checking on her and she said everything was great, but then complained about how awful everything was when I asked if she would like a box. Later that night, my manager told me she went to high school with that woman and she's crazy.\\n\\n\\n\\n**edited for formatting \", 't2_xtiy4', '\"What\\'s in a Gin and Tonic?\"', 't3_7nmm1a', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/7nmm1a/whats_in_a_gin_and_tonic/'), ('14qg4ny', '2023-Jul-04 09:04', 'BlueArchive', 't5_2vhvtt', '', 't2_oy9su', \"Yuuka's new passive skill (by AYA-cis @GinMei182_e) Noa\", 't3_14qg4ny', 'https://i.redd.it/ssk1syz7gy9b1.png'), ('qi48fj', '2021-Oct-28 23:02', 'arknights', 't5_3ptom', '', 't2_c14a5b', \"Gladiia's Glare (by gin_moku) Translated\", 't3_qi48fj', 'https://i.redd.it/qdjv9ywlcbw71.png'), ('968dd5', '2018-Aug-10 11:19', 'GifRecipes', 't5_3410y', '', 't2_it2zq2z', 'Rose Gin Sour Cocktail Recipe - Rose Wine and Gin GIF', 't3_968dd5', 'https://gfycat.com/SharpAgonizingKissingbug')\n",

What did you soak it in it?\"\\n\\nThe bartender tells him, \"Turn it around.\" So the guy does, takes another bite, and is suddenly quite pleased.\\n\\n\"It tastes like a coke! It\\'s a rum and coke apple? It\\'s a rum and coke apple! That\\'s pretty neat, pal.\"\\n\\nAnother man approaches the bar, and asks the bartender for a gin and tonic. The bartender hands him an apple.\\n\\nConfused, the man begins to question the validity of the bartender, when the first guy reassures him, \"Buddy, try the apple,\" and with a nod to his own, takes another bite.\\n\\nThe second man follows suit, and looks back at the bartender in exclamation, \"Tonic! What\\'s this, a tonic apple?\"\\n\\nThe bartender swirls his finger in the air and tells the man, \"Turn it around...\"\\n\\nThe man has a bite from the other side of the apple and is exuberant. \"It\\'s gin! It\\'s really gin! A gin and tonic apple!\"\\n\\nThe two men reveled in this discovery for a while, when a dwarf walked up to the bar, made his way onto a stool beside the men, and beckoned for the bartender. As he\\'s about to order, the second man interrupts him, \"Oh, hey man wait! You should order an apple! You can get an apple that tastes like anything you want here! I\\'ve got a gin and tonic apple, and this guy\\'s got a rum and coke apple!\"\\n\\nThe dwarf casts an incredulous look at the bartender, who plainly nods back in confirmation.\\n\\n\"Oh yeah?\" He starts, \"OK then, it\\'s been a while, gimme a *pussy* flavored apple!\"\\n\\nAnd the bartender hands him an apple.\\n\\nThe dwarf takes a big, expectant bite from the apple, and immediately spits it out all over the bar.\\n\\n\"Ughyuuk!!\" He cries out, \"This apple tastes like *shit*!\"\\n\\nThe bartender swirls his finger in the air and tells him, \"Turn it around...\"\\n\\n\\nEdit: Wow thanks for all the awards!

I binge on liquor. Almost exclusively barcardi white rum. As with anyone, the progression of the amount I drink has gradually increased in that time. At about 5 years ago, I hit the half a liter a night mark. From then, I slowly have progressed to what occurred two nights ago. I finished an entire liter. I blacked out probably shortly after finishing half. Black outs aren't exactly rare for me, in fact they've become the norm the last 3 years or so. I remember being at my desk and then waking up in bed. \\n\\nI don't remember anything but my husband sure did. Luckily I'm generally a calm. goofy drunk. Some times I get argumentative or just overly emotional but not often. So nothing bad happened per se, I was just clearly plastered. I ate a bunch of cookies he made, I was babbling incoherently, and I tried to heat up pizza in the microwave(I know gross) and couldn't get the microwave to work. Apparently I sat there and pushed buttons for about 5 minutes, then gave up and went to bed.\\n\\nI digress. What really hit me is this is the first time I've consumed so much alcohol drinking by myself in one sitting. I've had my party days in the past where I drank that much over a considerably longer time period, but never a liter in 4 hours. I looked it up, thats around 25 shots. Im a fairly large guy but I still should be dead, I should have had to go to the hospital, I should have had a terrible hangover. But I didn't. I called into work because I was still intoxicated in the morning. That doesn't happen very often to me.\\n\\n I am not sure if anyone else does, but I have defined milestones in the progression of my disease. Drinking like this seems to be a big one. I'm a little shaken by it. Mainly because it just seemingly happened. Like it was a regular Tuesday. Why all of a sudden such a big spike for me?\\n\\nMe and my husband have talked a lot about my issues with drinking. Its always the same conversation of slowing down or stopping all together. Sometimes I make it a day or two, but ultimately, I always quickly go back to everyday binging. We had a more serious conversation yesterday morning about putting a stop to it. He enjoys a glass of wine or two maybe once a week on a weekend. He has agreed to a dry house so I can recover. \\n\\nI am scared. I know I need to quit. I've tried so many times before. When the voice in my head plants the seed of drinking its like I can't go back. I can't get myself to stop obsessing over how I am going to drink. I plead with myself to stop but it just doesn't seem to matter. I know I am in some need of big changes in how I live day to day and how I take care of myself. It just seems so hard at the moment.\\n\\nIm not going to drink tonight but its still early. Once 4 o clock rolls around I am afraid my resolve wont be there anymore. Part of why I am writing this is in hopes that if I put my intentions out to the world maybe, Ill make it. I've wished for so long that I can just stop. That I don't need to make radical changes to get there. I am scared because my entire life I feel completely unmotivated. Like the desire to be sober isn't strong enough to get me to make changes. Sometimes I worry that nothing can happen in my life that would be motivation enough for me to stop. How do I over come that? It feels like implementing even the smallest change in routine is like climbing a mountain. I know its likely depression, but I've been this way my entire life. I've taken different medications. I've coupled that with therapy but nothing seems to work.\\n\\nEnough of my pity party. Thank you all for taking the time to read this. I hope everyone has a great day.\\n\\nThank you\", 't2_772ic6d74', 'Well it finally happened.

Jeg har, inspireret af den her tråd, samlet nogle hændelser fra den seneste måned, hvor jeg er blevet overrasket over, hvor lidt folk tænker over deres omgivelser og de mennesker, de deler dem med.\\n\\nHer er nogle eksempler:\\n\\n* Dem, som ikke giver en forlomme til personen bagved med en Cola, når man står med en bugnende indkøbsvogn.\\n* Dem, som skal gå side om side 3 personer på fortovet og pure nægter at lade en modgående få halvdelen af pladsen.\\n* Dem, som skal stå og snakke højlydt i mobiltelefon lige op ad en barnevogn.\\n* Dem, som slår en paraply op i en folkemængde, når man står med et lille barn på skuldrene, som er lige ved at få spiddet øjnene ud.\\n* Dem, som skal bruge nabosædet i S-toget til tasken.\\n* Dem, som ser TikTok med fuld lyd på.\\n* Dem, som bare smider bøger rundt på gulvet på det lokale bibliotek og ikke rydder op efter sig.\\n* Dem, som kører i midtersporet med 100 i timen når man må køre 110/130.\\n* Dem, som på en snæver vej nægter at holde tilbage foran en forhindring i deres side af vejen.\\n* Dem, som skal bruge elevatoren i S-toget, når der er 3 barnevogne i kø.\\n* Dem, som bare stopper op på Strøget og ikke tjekker, om nogen er ved at gå ind i dem.\\n* Dem, som skal gå tværs ind foran andre, så man må stoppe op.\\n* Dem, som bare skaber deres egen kø på kaffebaren, i Imerco, jeg kunne blive ved.\\n* Dem, som skal møve sig helt op foran køen på cykelstien, for så at køre i snegletempo og blive overhalet af alle de andre.\\n\\nJeg forstår, at der er en slags karma i det, og at folk måske opfører sig sådan på grund af andres handlinger mod dem. Men jeg er selv opdraget med, og forsøger at efterleve, det princip om at vise hensyn og være lidt \\'wholesome\\' i hverdagen, simpelthen for at vi alle får det lidt bedre. Men jeg begynder at blive træt af, hvor lidt hensyn, der bliver vist i det offentlige rum.\\n\\nJeg er nysgerrig efter at høre, om andre også har oplevet en tiltagende mangel på hensyn i det offentlige rum.

Pass ma auf.\\n\\n\\nIch hab heute malocht und Überstunden auf nem Freitag geschoben. Dann gönn ich mir erschöpft ne Portion Gyros, dessen Größe gegen die Genfer Konventionen verstieß. Überfressen rollte ich mich aufs Sofa. Es stellte sich gar ein Körpergefühl ein, nach dem ich mein Leib eines übernatürlich gigantischen Umfanges wähnte, der fast der Mutter des hier lesenden Mitmenschens entspricht. Kurzum: Ich war enorm vollgefressen, aber glücklich. Fast glücklich. Feierabend, gefressen, aber da war doch noch was!\\n\\n\\nEi der Daus! Des Morgens wurde ich gewahr, dass mir die Rektalservietten ausgegangen sind. Ich notierte mir mental, ein Paket selbiger nach der Arbeit käuflich zu erwerben. Doch - es war mir entfallen! Die Opportunität versäumt lag ich dort nun, ich armer Tropf. Doch der menschliche Anus richtet die Ausführung seiner Pflicht zeitlich nicht nach der Verfügbarkeit von Arschtapeten. So erhob ich mich alsdann, legte mein Gewand an und kämpfte meinen steinernen Körper hinaus, gen Kaufmannsladen.\\n\\n\\nAuf dem Wege dorthin sah ich, bereits nur noch die etwaige Wurfweite einer handelsüblichen Dreckskatze entfernt, zwei Knaben tänzelnd des Bürgers Steg entlangflanieren. Für einen kurzen Moment fragte ich mich: \"*Wieso sind die noch draußen? Allein? Es ist nach 20 Uhr!*\" Der Schein regelmäßig aufgestellter Straßenlaternen beleuchtete die Leiber der Rabauken: Einer dünn, mager und lang. Der andere rundlich, gar fett mit kurz geschorenen Haaren und einem T-Hemd, dass die Aufschrift \"ellesse\" zierte, gleich oberhalb einer ebenfalls aufgedruckten, simplizistisch, gar die Realität beleidigend herabstilisierten Abbildung eines handelsüblichen Croissants. Bewegungsweise und Aussehen der Buben ließen gemeinsam den Schluss zu, dass sie bereits rund 9-11 Sonnenumläufe auf dem runden Haufen Weltraumscheiße zugebracht haben, den wir gemeinhin als \"Erde\" bezeichnen und gleichermaßen seit Dekaden zunehmend kapitalistisch niederficken.\\n\\n\\nDoch zugleich weigerte ich mich, solch kleinbürgerlich-konservative Auswüchsen Einkehr in meinen Denkapparat zu gewähren und schob die Gedanken fort.\\n\\nDoch dann geschah es. Der dicke Knabe fragte mich im Vorbeigehen:\\n\"**Spielst du Fortnite?**\"\\nMir rutschte gar das Monokel aus dem Gesicht! Was für eine absurde Frage! \\'**Sehe ich aus wie ein Mann, der noch nie die Wärme eines Weibes Schoßes verspürt hat?**\\' wagte ich schon fast zu entgegnen, doch besann mich meines gesellschaftlich-solidarischen Allgemeinauftrages - sei ein guter Mensch!\\n\\n\\n\"**Nein.**\", antwortete ich also schmunzelnd. Nicht einmal herabwertend. Vielmehr die Naivität dieser Lausebengel belächelnd und vielleicht auch ein wenig ihren vermeintlich kindlich Frohsinn beneidend.\\n\\nAlsdann - jene Jungs waren bereits an mir vorbeigeschritten - vernahm ich die apokalyptische Entgegnung der dreckigen Croissanthemd-Fettbacke: \"**War klar, du Lappen!**\" Dann eilten beide fluchs kichernd davon.\\n\\nDie Tragweite dieser Äußerung noch nicht ganz realisierend und in Gedanken bereits die Auswahl an Hämorrhoidenschmirglern durchgehend, die der Kaufmannsladen feil bietet, ging ich ungestört weiter. Im Ladengeschäft angekommen wurde ich dieser Frechheit erst ganz gewahr. Was war das?! Was waren das bitte für bekackte Hurenkinder?! Ich spürte ein wenig Wut in mir. \\n___________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\nExkurs: **Heinrich Popitz Gewalttheorie**\\n\\nWir schreiben die 1980er Jahre. Der bedeutende Anthropologe und Soziologe Heinrich Popitz hängt hinter seinem Schreibtisch in einem Büro der Universität Freiburg. Als Gründungsdirektor schiebt er sich einen recht lauen Lenz und weiß - alle weiblichen Studis wollen seinen Hahn. Eigentlich! Ja, eigentlich! Aber nun liegt seit heute, an diesem kalten Herbsttag, die Überlegung nahe, dass dies doch nicht ganz der Realität entspricht. Manchmal bekommt er gar Körbe von den Damen! Ja, er wird alt.\\n\\nErst letztens kaufte er Ziesen am Kiosk. Schön im Morgenmantel. Als der Kioskzigeuner ihn gerade bedienen wollte, drängelte sich eine abgehalfterte Göre vor und kaufte ein bebildertes Komikstreifen-Schundblatt. Es war damals früh am morgen, sein Organismus hatte bisher weder Kaffee noch Lungenbrötchen aufgenommen und durch die entsprechende Abhängigkeit von diesen Stoffen erfuhr Popitz leichte Entzugserscheinungen, die sich in Unmut und Gereiztheit äußerten. Er wäre jedoch kein Mann der Wissenschaft, wenn er diese nicht in Zaum halten könnte. Und das gelang ihm auch.\\n\\n\\nDoch heute, am Schreibtisch sitzend, wurde im klar, was in diesem Moment im Kiosk durch seinen Kopf ging. Gewaltphantasien. Erschreckend brutale Gewaltfantasien, die man nur wenige Jahre später tatsächlich mit \"F\" schreiben darf. \\n\\nEr griff nach seinem Bleistift und kritzelte in sein Notizheft.\\n\\nIn diesem Jahr ~~1886~~ 1986 entstand Popitzens Werk \"Phänomene der Macht\". Hier formulierte er eine ernüchternd brutale Feststellung: Durch die endlosen Möglichkeiten der menschlichen Vorstellungskraft spielt Gewalt als maßlose, entgrenzte Form eine wesentliche Rolle in unserem gesellschaftlichen Zusammenleben. Darüber hinaus verfügen wir über eine beständige Verletzungmächtigkeit, die uns auch absolut bewusst ist. Gewalt ist immer eine Option. Der Staat nimmt uns die Ausübung dieser, auch in subsitutioneller Form, zwar weitgehend ab, aber wir *könnten*. \"*Verfickte Scheiße*\", denkt Popitz. \"*Ich könnte jedem Arschloch zu jeder Zeit was aufs Maul geben! Rrrrichtig nice!*\" Und damit lag er richtig. \\n\\n________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n**Zurück in die Gegenwart**\\n\\nEine verpasste Chance? Hätte ich diesem Bengel eine Schelle mitgeben sollen? Nein! Unverantwortlich. Er war ein ärmlicher kleiner Zockerlümmel. Eine Ulkgestalt. Aber ich hätte gekonnt. Ich hätte gekonnt!\\n\\n\\nSchnell stellt sich eine andere Idee ein. Der Hundeboy vergaß womöglich, dass er sich in einem sehr überschaubaren Viertel bewegt. Dass Nachbarn sich hier auf kurz oder lang regelmäßig über den Weg laufen. Dass man irgendwann weiß, er hier in der Ecke wohnen muss und wer nur vorbeilaufendes Fleisch darstellt. \\n\\nUnd so soll es sein, schwöre ich mir: Bub, ich werde dich wieder sehen. Ich werde Ausschau halten. Nach deinem erbärmlichen Croissantlumpen. Nach deinen kurzgeschorenen Haaren, die, gepaart mit deiner Statur und deinen Videospielvorlieben schier schreien: *Ich dusche nicht gern! Wenn Mama sagt, dass Waschtag ist, haue ich immer! Sie kauft mir trotzdem Markenklamotten, weil Papa nen guten Job hat und sie mit mir überfordert ist und sich nicht durchsetzen kann!*\\nSchwabbelbacke, ich krieg dich ran. Ich werde dich wiedersehen, wenn du mit deinen Eltern unterwegs bist. Und dann werde ich petzen. Ich werde von einem Erwachsenen zum anderen sprechen. Wohlformuliert und freundlich teile ich deinen Eltern mit, dass ihr Sohn in ihrer Abwesenheit erwachsene Menschen anpöbelt. Dass er  irgendwo keine Grenzen kennt und das ich es zu schätzen wüsste, wäre ich Vater und jemand würde mich nett über die Missetaten meines Kindes informieren, sodass ich erzieherische Härtemaßnahmen walten lassen oder gar meine eigenen Handlungen reflektieren und mögliche Fehlentscheidungen im Umgang mit meines eigen Fleisch und Blutes identifizieren kann. \\n\\n\\nJa, du kleiner, respektloser, verzogener Sohn einer Mutter. So wird es sein. Ich habe Geduld. Ich habe eine neue Packung Kackpappe, aber ich werde fortan dermaßen viele griechische Säulen ins Porzellan hinablassen, dass mein Verbrauch dieses Stuhlpergaments sich steigert.

Straight to the point. \\n\\nPus drinks about half of his shot and then finishes the rest; also mirroring how he’s coming to terms with the fact that he knows what’s about to happen and why he’s in a boat in the middle of the fucking ocean. \\n\\nTony finishes his shot last, taking a small sip before staring at his glass almost hesitantly before finishing the rest of the shot. He doesn’t want to accept the shot just like he’s hesitant and upset to accept that Pussy is a rat. “Why are you making me do this you fat fucking miserable piece of shit?” \\n\\nSil, who seemed emotionally distraught (yelling back at Tony, stepping away from the conversation and coming back downstairs looking like he just cried, pulling out his gun last) doesn’t even take a shot.

We were looking for things to do and my dad says he'll buy my brother and I a snorkeling trip for the next day. We agreed, had dinner, then me and my bro go to the bar at our resort for some drinks. My dad warns us not to get too wasted because the snorkeling trip is booked for 8am. Whatever Dad. We get to the bar, meet some girls, one thing leads to another and I get absolutely hammered off tequila shots. Blackout. Wake up to my dad knocking on the door pissed off saying to get the fuck out on the boat. \\n\\nHere's where the story begins. The rocking boat, scorching sun, and cheap tequila hangover were bad enough; then about two hours in I get the urge to explosively shit my shorts. No bathroom. I didn't want to move, but I decided taking a good ole fashion aqua-deuce is better than shitting on the deck. I grab some goggles, get in the water and swim away from the group of people. I figure I'm a good distance away, dive down a little, pull my shorts down and let loose. This was some next level shit. There's shit floating all around me, and that`s when I realize that fish fucking love shit. Tons of fish start pecking at it, and at this point some of the snorkelers are heading over since there's so many fish. I panic because I'm surrounded by my own feces so I just start wack-a-mole-ing the floating turds, trying to break them up. This causes more fish to come and more snorkelers as well. Before I know it, I'm surrounded by fish and snorkelers... and we are all swimming in my shit. In the end I'm not sure if anyone noticed my shit floating around, but it was still embarrassing as hell.\\n\\nTL;DR Got wasted, went snorkeling hung over, explosively shit in the ocean causing fish and snorkelers to swim in it.\\n\\nEdit: I realize all tequila is Mexican, I just meant local no-name tequila, for sure not for export. \", 't2_p6hcu', 'TIFU by drinking too much Mexican tequila (NSFW)', 't3_3we6l0', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/3we6l0/tifu_by_drinking_too_much_mexican_tequila_nsfw/'), ('w8ngc7', '2022-Jul-26 10:59', 'PublicFreakout', 't5_2yrq6', '', 't2_hitha', \"⚠️Warning⚠️ NSFL: Bodycam footage shows a police dog in San Jose, CA biting on a man's neck for over a minute after he was suspected of helping his girlfriend steal tequila from a Safeway\", 't3_w8ngc7', 'https://v.redd.it/ocg67paa8zd91'), ('8568ht', '2018-Mar-17 14:56', 'instant_regret', 't5_32dy0', '', 't2_iqsg6', 'Trying to take a tequila shot with the kids', 't3_8568ht', 'https://v.redd.it/vqvifnxp3ml01'), ('gwkwnu', '2020-Jun-04 11:35', 'StardustCrusaders', 't5_2tny5', '', 't2_46cq9sf6', 'Fanart Tequila Joseph by 疾速k', 't3_gwkwnu', 'https://i.redd.it/995hunu88x251.jpg'), ('li69ng', '2021-Feb-12 01:33', 'memes', 't5_2qjpg', '', 't2_79ejugz3', 'Shouldn’t you drink tequila too?', 't3_li69ng', 'https://i.redd.it/dr8e7bz720h61.jpg'), ('ibzapm', '2020-Aug-18 06:32', 'educationalgifs', 't5_2w708', '', 't2_48e8fxe', 'How Tequila are made from Agave', 't3_ibzapm', 'https://gfycat.com/pepperydefiniteeastsiberianlaika'), ('ilq5ja', '2020-Sep-03 04:21', 'ShitPostCrusaders', 't5_3f7q5', '', 't2_6hd1jitb', 'TEQUILA JOSEPH MOUSE PAD', 't3_ilq5ja', 'https://i.redd.it/b2dvzt6vhwk51.jpg'), ('mnl90i', '2021-Apr-09 11:39', 'SquaredCircle', 't5_2sljg', '', 't2_4szkmd3', 'The Rock on 46% wanting to see him as president: Not sure our Founding Fathers ever envisioned a six-four, bald, tattooed, half-Black, half-Samoan, tequila drinking, pick up truck driving, fanny pack wearing guy joining their club - but if it ever happens it’d be my honor to serve the people 🙏🏾💪', 't3_mnl90i', 'https://twitter.com/TheRock/status/1380551319690301443?s=19'), ('10k9tzl', '2023-Jan-24 10:47', 'EnoughMuskSpam', 't5_3blr7', '', 't2_eewsy4db', 'Some regrets on the $400 tequila', 't3_10k9tzl', 'https://i.redd.it/khhhb4pla2ea1.jpg'), ('k37e4m', '2020-Nov-29 04:38', 'exmormon', 't5_2r0gj', '', 't2_652qp', 'Who says you can’t have your own fun while waiting outside the temple?

When he's sober he's an amazing human and I'd love to spend the rest of my life with him, but when he's drunk he's horrid. He lies, he steals the drinks from other people, and tonight was my last straw.\\nI work for a sales company (won't name for private reasons) and had a gig tonight that i had to be at. I get paid every Friday and had close to no gas. When I was done at the gig I noticed my fiance hadn't responded in well over 4 hours which is not normal, unless he's drinking because he doesn't want me to know. (Mind you we live together) my grandma sent me 20$ on Venmo so I could get gas and make it home as without it I would've been stuck until morning. My venmo has not been working so my fiance and I have just been using his as we have a joint account for bills and stuff. Well, he took that money and went and spent it on alcohol, and I was stuck for two hours before I finally caved and called my mother in law in tears explaining what happened. Luckily my father in law came and put gas in my car and hung our for a few so I could calm down. I've been up all night (it's 6 am here) trying to figure out what to do. The only thing I can think of is go and stay with my grandma a few hours away for a month or two. It makes me feel guilty but this has been going on for months and no matter how many times he swears he's done, he never is. I'm exhausted, and I am starting to resent him. He saved my life when my mom dad when I was 17, but at some point enough is enough, right?\\n\\nEdit: thank you everyone for the advice:) I truly do appreciate and I'm reading as many of the comments as I can. I've made the decision that in two weeks I'll need going to my grandmothers for 30 days. Ultimately I need therapy for a load of mental health problems I've been dealing with since I was 12 and I won't do it myself.

Sat down and cracked open a tinny without thinking about it. A few sips in, he taps me and politely asks me if it’d be okay if I didn’t drink. I ask why (note that where I am, drinking on public transport is perfectly legal – unsure if this is the case everywhere) and he says that he can’t be in the presence of anyone drinking alcohol. \\n\\nI have a think, and a quick look around to see if there are any free seats, but alas there are none. I apologise and say that I won’t be on the train for too many stops but I’d like to have my drink. He begrudgingly accepts, turns his back to me, and I have my two small cans before getting off. \\n\\nSo what do you think? And problems with what I did? Or perhaps it would have been better if I only had the initial drink I’d already opened and nothing else?\\n\\nEDIT: Some FAQs – while he didn’t explicitly tell me he was Muslim he was dressed in the full gear of an imam so I can pretty safely assume he was. He was also white. It is possible there are other reasons he couldn’t be around alcohol (potentially a former alcoholic) but this didn’t cross my mind at the time, nor did it before I read some of your comments. Mind you, his tone and a subtle gesture to demonstrate his outfit indicated to me it was about religion, but I could well have misread this.\\n\\nIncident happened entirely in England, although the train had originally come from Scotland (may be unimportant – but I’m Scottish and the man in question was English). Perhaps more important – drinking on the train is illegal in Scotland, but not in England.\\n\\nEDIT (2): One of the best points I’ve heard from a friend was that the guy was white and English, meaning that he was quite possibly not raised a Muslim and may not be as intimately familiar with Islamic law around alcohol, and/or he may have turned to Islam recently after struggling with something such as alcoholism.

I know, quite a broad range right there. Anyway, the company I work for is quite old and the building I work in is even older. The heating system is trash and we really lack anything in the way of air conditioning, and it\\'s boiling outside right now.\\n\\nEarlier today, I had started overheating really quickly as the temperature rose in the building. I have a medical condition where my body can\\'t regulate temperature well, meaning I am at risk of passing out. I was going to go get a bottle of water from the fridge to help me cool down, when I was stopped by one of the company\\'s managers. Let\\'s call him Kyle for this story.\\n\\nKyle: Where are you going?\\n\\nMe: I was only going to go get some water.\\n\\nKyle: You\\'re supposed to be working right now. You can get the water during the coffee break.\\n\\nMe: I.. I don\\'t think you understand that I can actually be in danger from this heat right now. So, could I please go get one bottle of water?\\n\\nKyle: No. You\\'re not authorized to leave your work before the clock strikes. Now shut up, and get back to work.\\n\\nMe: Roger that..\\n\\nKeep in mind that this conversation was held in front of my coworkers. Cue malicious compliance.\\n\\nI got back to work, making sure to put on some extra coal, just to make sure I \"made up for lost time\". Basically I was forcing my body into shock and heat stroke was just around the corner. Fast forward around 30 minutes, I had to tell my coworkers through my strained breath that I don\\'t feel too good. Which was actually even worse now, as I was working on deck of one of these boats, give or take 3 meters above the floor. When I made my way towards the ladder to climb down I only got out a very strained \"Oh... Shit...\" as I fell off the back, and was headed straight for the concrete floor below me.\\n\\nLucky for me, some coworkers reacted fast enough and managed to catch me before my head was split open on the floor.\\n\\nI woke up in an ambulance around an hour later. The EMTs were checking my vitals and were actually helping me. My boss came up to the door and asked me what happened. I told him exactly as I told you guys, and I also told him to check with my coworkers if he didn\\'t believe me.\\n\\nLong story boring, I was brought to the hospital for a check up just to make sure I actually didn\\'t suffer any kind of trauma from the fall. A buddy of mine came with me to make sure I got there and back safe. A few hours passed, and my buddy got a call, he picked it up, and it was Kyle. My buddy handed me the phone, and I heard Kyle on the other end apologizing for actually almost getting me killed.\\n\\nThe short version is that he was heavily reprimanded for what he told me and was put on watch. Didn\\'t lose his position tho so I guess I didn\\'t fully win. But he was liable for the medical compensation for my situation.\\n\\nI did forgive him and just to rub it in a bit, I just had to ask him. \"Am I authorized to get water next time?\" And my buddy just laughed.\\n\\nEdit: I already got OSHA on the line and they\\'re launching an investigation into this. So. If nothing else, I just made Kyle\\'s week even more horrible.\\n\\nAlso, for those who wondered. Kyle is pretty new and is basically a bit of a... brick?... can I call him that?... Whatever. He\\'s rough around the edges and generally doesn\\'t believe people when it comes to their personal health. He\\'s got that kind of \"If you can talk, then you can work\" mentality.\\n\\nSo. In a way. He kinda deserved this. OSHA will have a field day with his actions.\\n\\nEdit 2: Fixed the Cue spelling error. Man I\\'m dumb\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Update**(https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/14lz0yc/update_im_not_allowed_to_get_water_okay/) **(2 days later)**\\n\\nFirst of all hello again. I\\'m the idiot that almost died to prove a point. Before I continue, to all of you who were concerned about my safety and health. Thank you. I never realized how many would care.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nI\\'d also like to apologize for literally putting my own life in danger to prove a point. It was stupid. My family, the nurses, my girlfriend, and many of you made me realize just how stupid I was, and I will be more careful in the future.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nI am now out of the hospital after being completely stabilized and I don\\'t have any major trauma from this ordeal. So don\\'t worry.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nAnyway, for those of you not in the loop, check my profile for the previous post.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nFor those of you who already know, let\\'s get into this.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nA lot of things happened so far. My aunt (the main nurse assigned to me) and the nurses I knew personally all cussed me out for what I did and told me to make sure I better get health and safety to invade my job for this. My aunt put me in contact with a representative and I had a lengthy chat with said representative. This got the ball rolling for investigations to start.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nWhat I didn\\'t expect, was that even police had to get involved. I was released from the hospital after a day and was told that I could work, but I was entitled to 10 minute breaks every hour if the temperature rose above 25°C indoors. Which, basically is every hour of the day. Anyway. I clocked in today and was immediately approached by some a man and woman in high-vis and hard hats. The woman introduced herself as the representative I had spoken to on the phone, and she basically asked me to back track and explain in detail what happened. I did, and she wrote everything down and let me be on my way, after reminding me to abuse my medical papers as much as I felt like. Dunno why. She just said that and walked away.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nDidn\\'t hear much more after that. The entire company was called into a large meeting about personal safety. And it was quickly established that I was the cause of said safety meeting. Whoops...\\r  \\n\\r  \\nAnyway. We were informed that Kyle (the dillweed manager) had been demoted to a normal worker, and that we would be entitled to 5 minute breaks every hour due to the heat. Nice.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nHe also said, that due to the heat, the company would be purchasing drink coolers, fans, and would be compensating any worker that had to go home due to illness prompted by the heat.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nThis part tho, shocked me. \"Frost is not allowed in any engine bay until winter due to temperatures in there being close to a sauna.

My older brother, Charlie (then 19, now 29), ghosted. He was an alcoholic and felt it was all too much. It’s a choice I now understand as an adult, but as a kid, of course it hurt. I was raised by both my grandmother and older sister, Renee (then 17, now 27). My grandmother did all she could, but she was older and relied on Renee a lot.\\n\\nWhen I was 17, Charlie came back into our lives, 2 years sober. Renee and I forgave him. I am now very close to him and we’ve bonded a lot. I actually live with him now while I go to college because he lives literally right up the road.\\n\\nI do party on occasion, but it’s very rare I get drunk. Now, I always assumed that Charlie knew I drank. I’m in college. Not every college student parties, but when I’m at out past midnight, I figure it’s obvious I’m not playing Scrabble or whatever.\\n\\nI crashed at a friend’s on Wednesday night after having a bit too much to drink. I returned to Charlie’s, hungover. It wasn’t quite obvious at first but then I started throwing up. He figured it out and began lecturing me. Said I’m 20, not legally able to drink, it’s not safe to get wasted at a college party. Told me that I shouldn’t drink at all at my age. He wasn’t yelling, more matter of fact than anything.\\n\\nI wasn’t feeling great, had a headache and found his rant hypocritical. I told him such. He started drinking at 15, had a huge problem at 19. He abandoned our family when we needed him most. He has no right to judge me or act like a protective big brother now. Charlie got quiet, walked out of the room and later left for work. He hasn’t said much to me since. He’s definitely not mad, just sad and hurt.\\n\\nRenee told me I crossed a line. While she’s fine with me drinking and thinks Charlie overreacted a little, she said I went way too far in throwing back all that in his face. Especially as I’ve never brought it up before. She says the most I should’ve said was that I was safe while drinking and I understood his concern, but I could do what I wanted as an adult.\\n\\nI’m starting to feel bad. Was I wrong?\\n\\n***Relevant Comments:***\\n\\n*Someone points out brother may have been worried for her safety:*\\n\\n\"I didn’t consider that he was worried about me being vulnerable around guys. I just thought he was talking about driving, which I didn’t do. I walked to a friend’s dorm.\"\\n\\n*You share a genetic predisposition for alcoholism:* \\n\\n\"While I don’t think I have a problem, our mom was a heroin addict and it contributed to her death. Her mom was an alcoholic. Pretty sure her sister was too. So, it is genetic. Doesn’t mean I have it, but the commenter and my brother aren’t wrong to be concerned, I’m learning.\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, I didn’t know much about the genetic part but when you said it and I look at our family history…you’re not far off. I don’t think I have a problem but it certainly is genetic in our family.\"\\n\\n*Many people point out just how much OOP overreacted:* \\n\\n\"You’re absolutely right. I’m definitely becoming embarrassed.\"\\n\\n*It wasn\\'t your brother\\'s responsibility to care for you:*\\n\\n\"I don’t think he had a responsibility to take care of anyone. I do think he had a responsibility to just not up and leave. So maybe people are right. Maybe I am not really over it.\"\\n\\n\"I’ve thought about therapy a lot. I guess it’s time to think about it more.\"\\n\\n***OOP is voted YTA***\\n\\n**Update (Same Post): April 22, 2023 (Next Day)**\\n\\nUpdate: First of all, thank you for being so honest with me. A lot of it was very hard to read and I didn’t want to accept it, but I know I needed to.\\n\\nI still do not think I have a drinking problem. I know that’s what every alcoholic says, but I truly do not get as drunk as I did that often. At the same time, I recgonize addiction is genetic and Charlie is not the only person in our family that struggles with it. Considering that, I am going to take a break from drinking for a little while and if/when I start again in the future (after I turn 21 at a minimum), I will be more careful when it comes to how much I consume and the venue in which I consume it.\\n\\nA lot of you pointed out that Charlie was right about the safety concern. I was getting wasted at a college party. I didn’t include this in the post, which is unfair looking back as it’s important context, but none of my friends were sober either. So, I had no one looking out for me nor was I looking out for myself. I see now all the things that could’ve happened.\\n\\nThe big takeaway is that I am not “okay” or “over” with what happened. I buried it down because I just wanted a relationship with my brother again and then as soon as I was reminded of that time, I lashed out. I plan to look into finding a therapist because clearly, there’s a lot of unresolved issues.\\n\\nFinally, I knew early on after posting that I owed Charlie an apology. I ordered dinner for us last night and apologized. I said I understood that he was concerned and he had every right to be. I also said I had no right to throw everything back in his face. Charlie apologized for everything he put the family through, but I told him that he already had. He repeated that he was just very worried about me turning into him. I thanked him for his concern and told him I’m grateful for him, I love him.\\n\\nI am not foolish to think everything is okay. He knows now that I’m struggling with everything. I also can’t take back the words I said or what a brat I was. But we’re going to try moving forward and find healing.\\n\\n**If you\\'re in the US and need help with substance abuse, check out this** link(https://www.samhsa.gov/find-help/national-helpline) **for resources.**', 't2_51nvnr4', 'AITA for throwing my brother’s alcoholism back in his face when he expressed concern about me drinking?', 't3_132jg4c', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/132jg4c/aita_for_throwing_my_brothers_alcoholism_back_in/')\n",

I\\'m talking like it feels like someone is churning butter in my stomach. Yet, even knowing this, sometimes I just can\\'t resist having a nice warm cuppa coffee in the morning. That was the case this morning.\\n\\nSo, as usual, I make my coffee - milk, creamer, the whole 9 yards, and I sit down and start drinking it. I got about halfway through my cup and thought to myself, huh, weird. My stomach hasn\\'t started hurting yet! Which I was grateful for, so I just continued on with my coffee. I finished my cup, and hallelujah!! No stomach problems!!\\n\\nLater that day, I had made plans to go camping with some friends at a lake. So, it\\'s about 1:00 and I\\'m packing my stuff to go to the lake. I\\'m on my way there, when all of the sudden, uh oh. Looks like the coffee has caught up with me. No worries, I have a while till my friends get to the lake, so I\\'ll find a porta potty and deal with it then. \\n\\nI get to the lake, and apparently my friends decided to show up early. Ok... no worries. Can still go find a toilet somewhere away from where we\\'re camping. Well, lo and behold, there was literally one porta potty at this lake, (the lake is owned by someone in my family, it\\'s not a public lake), and this porta potty happened to be literally right near where we were camping. Ok so I have 2 options. 1, proceed to the porta potty, where will undoubtedly cause it to smell like toxic waste for the rest of the day, and risk our campsite smelling like dookie all night, or 2, try and hold it long enough to drive back to my house (roughly 15 minutes away). \\n\\nI decided there was no way I could hold it that long, so I ask my friends to walk down to the lake and see if they could find a nice spot to set up chairs for fishing, while I set up my tent. While they are doing that, I go into the porta potty and my bowels invoke the wrath of lucifer on that poor innocent toilet. So, I get done emptying my entire stomach into the porta potty, and walk out to set up my tent. My friends come back, and instantly one of them goes, \"what is that HORRIBLE SMELL.\" So I play it off and go, \"yeah fr, I smelled that too wtf is that\". So my friend goes to investigate, and walks into the porta potty and instantly froze and went \"dude. who the fuck shat themselves in here\". So of course, being the noble person I am, I said \"dude idk, maybe it was (the other friend camping with us)\". I then convinced him to not mention it, so as to not embarrass our friend. \\n\\nSo, we decided there was no way we could camp this close to this putrid stench, so we told the friend that we found a flatter spot to set up tents, and that was that. Sorry to my friend who had to take the blame for the smell of hell\\'s anus in the porta potty.\\n\\nTLDR: I drank coffee knowing that it would give me stomach problems, went camping, and had to blame my friend for the porta potty smelling like a feces factory.\\n\\nEDIT: Wow, ok, this blew up. Let me clarify some points here.\\nFirst of all, to everyone saying MILK AND CREAMER??? Have y\\'all never heard of half and half??\\nSecondly, this porta potty wasn\\'t like a green one with the blue juice in the bottom that you can rent out, it was one built by my family who owns the lake, and it was built recently so no it didn\\'t smell yet.\\nThird, the reason we were camping so close is because my friend has IBS, and that\\'s why I decided to just say it was him and we didn\\'t say anything about it so he wouldn\\'t be embarrassed.

We have not announced that were trying for a baby because it will result in our families lecturing us about getting married and having a wedding. We do not want a wedding and marriage isn't important to us.\\n\\nWe have a family wedding to attend this weekend, therefore I took a pregnancy test, just to double check, before a weekend of heavy drinking. Well it was positive and we are so excited. I do not want to announce that I am pregnant until we go to the doctor or after 12 weeks. This happened so quickly I am not sure what to do. The bride has been dreaming about her wedding day her whole life and all the attention should be on her. I do not want to take her spotlight. This will be the first grandchild in the family and I assume that everyone will be so excited.\\n\\nThe problem is that I drink alcohol and get drunk at every family event. My family loves to party and we take shots together, shotgun beer together, and randomly challenge each other to chugging contests. I am fully involved in the festivities and instigate a lot of the drinking. Basically, it will be very noticeable that I am not drinking and refusing shots. I am planning on pretending to drink beers by replacing it with water but I don't think this will actually fool my family.

Therefore, it does not happen during her wedding. I don't think making the announcement a few days before her wedding will actually help. In addition, I am uncomfortable with this because I've only taken at home pregnancy tests and have not been to the doctor. I do not know how far along I am. Plus, I am more terrified of the possibility of having to announce a miscarriage to the whole family. I hope I don't have a miscarriage but it's a possibility with any pregnancy and the chance drop significantly after 12weeks according to the internet. \\n\\n\\nTLDR: My family will notice that I am not heavy intoxicated during my cousin's wedding this weekend and correctly assume I am pregnant.

Partner came down, was furious she had no room temperature water to drink and we came to an agreement - dont fill up both jugs into the dispenser and leave her one.\\n\\nFast forward to Today, there was going to be some burst water main repairs outside by the utility company so in the morning before my partner woke up, I decided to make sure we had enough water to drink. I filled the dispenser with 1 jug, then halved the room temperature water in the other jug into both \\n\\n(we had previously shattered a jug on a cold day when we poured boiling water in, so I thought I\\'d temper this by making sure the boiling water would enter lukewarm water reducing chances of shattering the jugs)\\n\\nI went back to work and thought nothing of it. Partner wakes up and goes down and she is furious. She doesnt have any room temperature water. I try to placate her by mixing the lukewarm water with water from the dispenser to make \"room temperature\" water but its futile.\\n\\nShe wont relent. She tips the entire bottle of water I mixed out into the sink and tries herself and cant get the temperature right either. She is absolutely raging at me at this point for not listening to her or caring about her needs. She storms out of the house in a huff. \\n\\nSo AITA here or is perhaps this being blown out of proportion and mixing water to a specific temperature is not as big of a deal?\\n\\nEdit: Okay wow, this really blew up. Who knew water would be so polarising... never thought this post would start Lukewarm Watergate.  \\n\\nJust got off work and reading through all the replies. Looks like theres lots of questions so I\\'ll do my best to answer them and provide some clarity.\\n\\nThank you everyone for the comments, the stories, the judgements, and everything in between. Appreciate all the input so far and theres been some great takes that I\\'ll take to heart and consider properly. Including how best to communicate post watergate with my partner.\\n\\nSo more INFO:\\n\\nWho boiled the kettle and filled the jugs the previous night? I did\\n\\nWhy did you touch all the water? Firstly we dont have one jug for her and one for me, we have 2 jugs for the household (me and her). I forgot about the water mains being repaired until early this morning when the trucks showed up and they started working. I rushed down and made sure there was enough water for both of us. Not just me. On top of filling all the jugs and the dispenser and boiling another kettle full of water, I also filled a few sinks so we\\'d have extra water to flush the toilet if need be. I honestly thought the water would cool enough by the time she woke up since it\\'s a cold day, but I guess I was wrong? I didn\\'t expect her to react the way she did. \\n\\nIs she OCD? No, shes just pedantic about certain things and needs them to be a specific way. But I dont think it\\'s any more demanding than any other person who is neat and tidy and has certain idiosyncrasies. \\n\\nWhy don\\'t you drink from the tap?/Are you Asian? Yes, we are an Asian couple. Many of you have guessed that. Drinking boiled water is cultural, and a preference. There is nothing particularly wrong with the tap water in our country (Australia), but it \"tastes\" better to my partner after being boiled. Warm, but not boiling water tastes different than cooled to room temperature boiled water to her. \\n\\nSo it\\'s a preference. I preferred chilled water but I\\'d happily drink room temperature water or even warm if there wasnt any chilled water. I drink what we have, but preferred to have chilled. It doesnt affect me in any big way. This morning I just filled everything I could, including the dispenser.\\n\\nWhy dont you use ice? I can definitely use ice but our fridge has a built in dispenser (that we have to manually fill) so I do that from time to time with water from the jugs. Normally I will only ever use one, and leave one for her. This morning in my haste I used both as I wanted to make sure everything was full - dispenser, both jugs, and kettle.\\n\\nWhy dont you have more jugs? Trust me this is definitely our next step. As well as the brita water filter, but worried she might not like the taste... plus she might insist we boil it first before it goes into the brita. \\n\\nWhy did you pour half the water into an empty jug and fill both with boiling? As previously explained, we shattered a glass jug on a cold day previously pouring boiling water directly into it, because... science I don\\'t know the physics here. Anyways I was trying to avoid that and thought the boiling + room temperature water would cool sufficiently by the time she woke up. I calculated wrong. \\n\\nAnyways hope that clarifies most of the questions. Will post an update once we\\'ve reached an amicable resolution. My guess is that it\\'s not about the water as some people have already said but theres other underlying issues and this was a trigger.\\n\\nThank you for taking an interest and for all the comments!', 't2_4g7k59du', 'AITA for making my partners drinking water too warm?', 't3_vjclfg', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/vjclfg/aita_for_making_my_partners_drinking_water_too/'), ('13ulrnm', '2023-May-29 00:21', 'iamatotalpieceofshit', 't5_3jj03', '', 't2_im4ltoh', 'Driver and passenger drinking and driving with a toddler in the backseat', 't3_13ulrnm', 'https://v.redd.it/2avdbq25yq2b1'), ('w7duv3', '2022-Jul-24 22:13', 'mildlyinteresting', 't5_2ti4h', '', 't2_3dmb1', 'A scorpion drinking the condensation off of my beverage OC', 't3_w7duv3', 'https://i.imgur.com/MsEwNDo.jpg'), ('106sjnd', '2023-Jan-08 13:57', 'CasualUK', 't5_3j2jr', '', 't2_hnz21y96', 'Is drinking 2 bottles of wine an unacceptable amount to drink on a Sunday?

At first she seemed great. Nice, funny, smart, has three young kids who are awesome. We like having her around.\\n\\nExcept me and Lauren noticed something… every single time we’d get together, Sherry would try to make it into a “wine” night. Hang out to let the kids play at the playground in the evening? She’ll bring the wine! Hanging out after school sign up day? Wine time! Kid’s birthday party come around? Well, she’s got the beverages, including the wine!\\n\\nEvery single time we hang out, she HAS to have a glass in her hand. The glass turns into a bottle. The issue is that she does NOT seem like she’s had an entire bottle of wine.\\n\\nSo about two weeks ago, we had all planned on getting the kids together and going to a great water park. Obviously water + alcohol is a dangerous combo, especially with kids, so when Sherry pulled out a pint of Tito’s and waved it around telling everyone she had a “little treat” for the moms, I felt like I had to say something?\\n\\nI said “Oh I don’t think it’s good for us to mix alcohol at a water park like that, especially with the kids around.”\\n\\nShe said it would be fine, she does it all the time.\\n\\nAt this, I was kind of more alarmed. So when it was just the two of us, I said “Sherry, are you okay? Do you maybe need to talk to someone about your drinking?”\\n\\nShe looked shocked and said no, and then acted like I was absolutely crazy. She said she had no idea where I got that idea, that her drinking was absolutely normal, and that “where she’s from” (Atlanta?) it’s perfectly normal for people to drink at social gatherings.\\n\\nI said okay and that I was just concerned because I’ve never hung out with her when she hasn’t been drinking. She got defensive and told me that she didn’t like people up her ass monitoring her. After that point, her mood was soured for the day.\\n\\nLauren told me that it was a good thing that I said something, but two of the other moms said that it was going to cause a HUGE issue and that now Sherry’s talking shit about me being a busybody.\\n\\nI was not trying to shame her. But I know how being a SAHM can turn people into addicts real fast and I didn’t want to see her end up that way. AITA?\\n\\n**Edit:** Okay, you guys have all shown me that drinking a whole bottle of wine multiple times a week at normal everyday things like the playground or someone\\'s backyard is completely normal social drinking behavior. I\\'ll apologize to her and back off. \\n\\nThat\\'s not really behavior I\\'ve been exposed to, so maybe that\\'s why I\\'m surprised. Before she joined it would be common to have some wine around for things like birthday parties or BBQs, but not just for watching the kids play on a normal weeknight many times a week. I\\'ll apologize.\\n\\n**FINAL EDIT**: Some of you were right that my last edit was about 45 minutes after I posted, when most of the YTA comments happened and I was really shocked by the defense of her drinking. I sent this post to Lauren who is going to chat with the woman who is kind of the \"head\" of the circle and we\\'re going to work out a plan to stop Sherry\\'s drunk driving at the very least. \\n\\nI recognize that addressing the issue with her at the water park (we were in fact alone together, it was not in front of anyone else) wasn\\'t my best choice.

Since I had quit drinking in March, I’ve felt like absolute shit. I felt depressed and sluggish and foggy, and didn’t experience the pink cloud everyone talks about after they quit. Then I started having really bad memory issues. I would get home from an outing and completely forget where I had just returned from, conversations with people were completely forgotten, and I was struggling to just make it through the day so I could pass out and sleep. Then, I became suicidal so I talked to my psychiatrist about antidepressants and she prescribed me Zoloft, which had no effect. \\n\\nMy blood work came back this week and I was diagnosed with folate deficiency syndrome, a type of anemia related to folic acid, and was completely depleted of Vitamin D2. This is prevalent in pregnant women, the elderly in early stages of dementia, and alcoholics. The doctor explained that heavy, consistent intake of alcohol blocked folic acid receptors and kept the body from absorbing the necessary nutrients. This can lead to lethargy, forgetfulness, weakness in your muscles, etc. and, in very rare cases, can cause hearing loss. \\n\\nI had started going Deaf two years ago, and a cause was never determined. My heart plummeted. \\n\\nI was prescribed heavy doses of both Vitamin D2 and folic acid and within 2 days felt immensely better. I had more energy, the mental fog was gone, and my depression started lifting. \\n\\nI was so sure I had avoided any consequences of my drinking because I wasn’t exhibiting symptoms of cirrhosis or anything, but I had indeed done some damage. Fortunately it’s reversible at this stage, and I’ll be doing blood work every three months for the next year until my levels are stable again. However, I will not get my hearing back. I have a MRI scheduled for next week to see if there is physical damage to my auditory nerves or frontal lobe. \\n\\nI guess my point is that alcohol can damage us in so many ways, ways we don’t even consider. Alcohol is a poison and it destroys us from the inside out. This is why I will not drink, and IWNDWYT!\\n\\nEdit: wow I didn’t expect so many people to respond to this! There were a lot of questions I wasn’t able to answer in the moment so here’s a brief rundown of the most common questions asked\\n\\nDaily intake: two bottles of wine and two or three cocktails (by ounce, about 85 standard drinks a week)\\n\\nThe bloodwork wasn’t just for liver and kidney function, I asked them to check everything since I hadn’t seen my doctor for a check up in ages\\n\\nI noticed my hearing starting to change about two and a half years ago and saw my PCP for a hearing test, but they said it was normal. I repeated this three times before they sent me to an audiologist who conducted several more tests, and through a bone conductance test and speech recognition test identified the source of the hearing loss. I started using hearing aids last August \\n\\nThe depression and suicidal thoughts were initially believed to be related to my bipolar disorder, which is why it took a bit between quitting and getting blood work done to figure out that it was likely nutrient related rather than chemically related\\n\\nThey’ve started me on 50,000 units of vitamin D2 and folic acid (not sure of dosage) for 90 days \\n\\nThank you all for your support and encouragement in your comments!
